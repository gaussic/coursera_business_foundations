## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块3 - 利特尔法则

### 课程3.4 模块回顾和实践问题

围绕 **利特尔法则（Little's Law）** 展开，通过理论解析与案例实践，揭示了运营管理中库存、流速与流时间的动态关系，并扩展至人力资源管理的员工流失率分析。

#### 1. 利特尔法则的核心公式与跨领域应用

##### 1.1 基本公式

\[
\text{平均库存（I）} = \text{流速（R）} \times \text{流时间（T）}  
\]  
**变量定义**：  
- **I**：系统中正在处理的流程单元数量（如库存、员工数）；  
- **R**：单位时间内完成的流程单元数量（如客户处理量、员工离职率）；  
- **T**：单个流程单元从进入系统到离开的总时间（如客户等待时间、员工平均任期）。  

##### 2. 跨领域应用案例

- **呼叫中心**：25名客户/分钟到达（R），平均处理时间4.5分钟（T），则实时库存I=25×4.5=112.5人；  
- **制造业**：库存周转率=年销售成本（COGS）÷平均库存，若COGS为1501美元，库存590美元，则周转率=2.54次/年；  
- **员工管理**：Costco平均员工数160,000人（I），年招聘需求≈8,889人（R=160,000/18年），员工流失率≈5.56%。  

##### 3. 关键结论

- 利特尔法则适用于**任何稳定系统**，是运营优化的通用工具；  
- **降低库存（I）** 的核心在于缩短流时间（T）或提高流速（R），但需权衡资源投入与效率。

#### 2. 库存周转率与成本管理

##### 2.1 库存周转率计算

\[
\text{库存周转率} = \frac{\text{销售成本（COGS）}}{\text{平均库存}}  
\]  

- **案例**：某公司COGS=1501美元，库存590美元，周转率≈2.54次/年；  
- **单位库存成本**：若库存持有成本率15.25%，则单位成本=15.25% ÷ 2.54 × 85美元≈5.1美元/单位。  

##### 2.2 优化方向

- **减少流时间（T）**：例如通过JIT生产缩短制造周期，库存可降低50%；  
- **提高流速（R）**：如优化生产线平衡或采用自动化设备，提升产能利用率。  

##### 2.3 关键结论

- 库存周转率直接关联资金流动性，高周转率（如10次/年）企业比低周转率（如5次/年）单位利润高2.5%；  
- 制造业中，库存天数（Days of Supply）=365 ÷ 周转率，暴露供应链响应速度。

#### 3. 员工流失率与平均任期分析

##### 3.1 计算公式

\[
\text{员工流失率} = \frac{\text{年离职人数}}{\text{平均员工数}} \times 100\%  
\]  
\[
\text{平均任期（T）} = \frac{1}{\text{流失率}} \div 2  
\] 

- **案例**：某公司平均员工1500人（I），年离职500人（R），则流失率=33.3%，平均任期=1.5年。  

##### 3.2 管理启示

- **高流失率风险**：咨询行业平均任期2年（流失率25%），需高频招聘以维持规模；  
- **优化策略**：提升福利、职业发展机会，或限制并行任务数（如敏捷开发中控制WIP）以缩短开发周期。  

##### 3.3 关键结论  
- 员工流失率超过20%需警惕，可能反映企业文化或薪酬问题；  
- 平均任期与流失率成反比，Costco通过长期雇佣策略（平均任期9年）降低招聘成本。

#### 4. 利特尔法则的实践价值与限制

##### 4.1 价值

- **诊断工具**：通过已知两变量推算第三变量（如通过库存和流速计算流时间）；  
- **系统优化**：在供应链中协调各环节，平衡供需并减少牛鞭效应。  

##### 4.2 限制与注意事项

- **系统稳定性**：需满足稳态条件（流入≈流出），否则公式失效；  
- **数据准确性**：流时间（T）常因跟踪困难成为计算短板，需结合实时监控系统。  

##### 4.3 关键结论

- 利特尔法则助力企业从**经验管理转向数据驱动决策**，但其应用需结合具体场景验证；  
- 在动态环境中（如快速增长期），需分段计算平均员工数或库存量以提高精度。

#### 5. 模块练习题解析

1. **呼叫中心问题**：  
   - R=25人/分钟，T=4.5分钟 → I=112.5人（验证公式应用）；  
2. **库存成本问题**：  
   - 周转率=2.54次，单位成本=5.1美元（展示成本分摊逻辑）；  
3. **员工流失问题**：  
   - 流失率=33.3%，平均任期=1.5年（揭示人力资源规划依据）。  

**实践意义**：

- 练习题强化了利特尔法则的**量化分析能力**，为管理者提供快速诊断工具。

#### 总结

利特尔法则以简洁公式穿透复杂系统，成为运营管理的「万能钥匙」。无论是优化库存周转、降低员工流失，还是提升服务效率，其核心逻辑均指向**平衡与动态调整**。正如模块所述：「运营的本质是管理流动——从物料到人才，从数据到时间。」掌握此法则，企业可在效率与成本间找到最优解，构建可持续竞争力。

## 模块标题: Week 3: Little's Law

引言: 

Little's Law, a foundational concept in operations management, helps quantify and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of a system by providing key performance indicators. By understanding the relationship between inventory, arrival rate, and cycle time, managers can make informed decisions regarding capacity planning. Little’s Law also serves as a diagnostic tool for process improvement initiatives and is particularly valuable in supply chain management, where it enables companies to optimize inventory levels, reduce lead times, and enhance coordination among various stages of the supply chain. It helps strike a balance between supply and demand, improving overall responsiveness and customer service.

Learning Objectives:
- Compute employee turnover and average tenure
- Compute inventory turns and days of supply, determine the inventory costs
- Given two of the basic process flow measures, find the third using Little’s Law

### 第一章: Using Little's Law

#### 视频小节4: Module Review and Practice Problem

字幕文本: 

In this module we talked about Little's law. We use it to compute flow time given inventory and flow rate, we computed inventory turns and inventory cost and we look at the turnover of employees. In this last video of this module, I want to review the learning objectives, the key definitions and the key equations. I will then give you some opportunities to practice this new knowledge on a set of very specific practice problems. Let's start with our model review. Here are the learning objectives, I hope I brought across in this module. You should now be comfortable using Little's law to compute one of the three performance measures, I, R, and T given the other two. You should be able to do the inventory turns calculation and the employee turnover calculations. We've a bunch of new definitions. More importantly, we also have a bunch of formulas including Little's law itself. First practice problem. This is a little slow question where we have 25 callers coming in per minute. On average they are callers spend one minute on hold and 3.5 minutes talking to a service representative. Ask yourself how many callers are in the call center either on hold while talking to an agent. Put me on pause, wrestle with this by yourself, and then we'll do the problem together. Here we go. There are 25 callers arriving per minute on average. That is our flow rate R. The average caller spent one minute on hold and 3.5 minutes talking to the agent. That's offload time T. I = R *T. That's Little's law. We now have R, which is 25 calls per minute, and we have the flow time of 4.5 minutes. If we multiply those two and the minutes cancel out, and that leaves us with an inventory of hundred 12.5 callers on average. Next up we have an inventory turns problem. You'll see the following financial information here and I want you to find out the inventory turns for this company. Again, put me on pause now. Here's my shot at doing this. Drop the revenues focused on the COGS, the cost of goods sold. The revenues and the question here to just confuse you, I'm sorry. The inventory turns is COGS divided by the inventory. That is 1501 dollars per year, divided by the inventory which is expressed in dollars. The inventory we said is 590. This is not getting us to 0.54 turns per year. The units are one over years because it's turns, not years, its turns. Now, to get the inventory cost, we take the annual cost of inventory, the 15.25 per cent, and that's per year. The cost you would incur if you held the inventory for an entire year. But you're not holding it for an entire year, you're turning it to 0.54 time. Divide this by 2.54. Now you're applying this to the $85 of the item. You multiply this by $85 and this gives you roughly $5.1 per unit as a per unit inventory cost. The third and final practice problem of this module, we have a company with 1,500 employees on average, and it recruits 500 employees per year. I want you to find the employee turnover and the average tenure of the employee. Pause me now. What do we do? There are 1,500 employees on average, and on average 500 employees leave the company per year. The employee turnover is 500 employees per year divided by 1,500 employees. That is giving us a 1/3. The units for that are one over years. Again, it's a turn one over years. That gives us already a hint on the tenure on when they leave. That is a tenure on departure. On average before leaving, they're going to stay for three years. But that wasn't the question, I asked for the average tenure. For the average tenure, we have to take these three years and divide it by two. Some would be just studying and some will just be finishing their time at the company. On average, this is going to be 1.5 years. That's all I have to say for now. If you feel you're done, just get off the video. If you want to hear another Little's law story, hang on for another minute or two. A couple of years ago, I was at the Philadelphia Airport. Those were the days before we had TSA pre-check n. All passengers had to go through the same line. Believe me, it was a long line. When one day I arrived at gate B for my flight to San Francisco, I was greeted by a TSA officer who stood at the end of that long line. The officer was friendly and professional and handed me a form. This was the form, as you can see the form reads," Hello, I'm a representative of the Transportation Security Administration. TSA is a government agency responsible for making your travel secure. Please take this time stamped card and help us determine how long it takes you to get through the line." There was a little timestamp on the back of the car. You that would have been me, you have been selected because you're the last person in line. Thank you. Then it goes on to say, "Please give this card again to the line monitor at the beginning of the line. That's where we're going to timestamp it again and that allows us to compute how long you waited in line." You get it? They were measuring how long it takes me to go through security. In other words, they measure my flow time. What do you think? Is this how you would have measured flow time? Well, I didn't like it. I put on my professorial voice that I'm sure you know I have grown sick and tired of and I explained to this officer, "Look officer, why don't you simply count the number of passengers that are standing in line. That gives you your inventory. You know the flow rate, which is simply the number of passengers were boarding the airplane today and then you use Little's Law to find the flow time. Brilliant, isn't it? One of the leaves said is what I thought the officer I'm sure had his own opinion on that matter. See you in the next module.
