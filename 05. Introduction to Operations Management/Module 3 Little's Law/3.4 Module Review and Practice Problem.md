### **核心概念与公式回顾**  
1. **利特尔法则（Little's Law）**  
   \[
   \text{Inventory (I)} = \text{Flow Rate (R)} \times \text{Flow Time (T)}
   \]  
   • **应用范围**：适用于任何稳态系统（如库存、员工流动、客户服务流程）。  

2. **库存周转率与库存天数**  
   • **库存周转率**：  
     \[
     \text{Inventory Turns} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
     \]  
   • **库存天数**：  
     \[
     \text{Days of Supply} = \frac{\text{Average Inventory}}{\text{COGS}} \times 365
     \]  

3. **员工流动率与平均任期**  
   • **员工流动率**：  
     \[
     \text{Turnover Rate} = \frac{\text{Annual Departures}}{\text{Average Employees}}
     \]  
   • **平均任期**：  
     \[
     \text{Average Tenure} = \frac{\text{Average Employees}}{\text{Annual Departures}}
     \]

### **练习题解析**  
1. **呼叫中心库存计算**  
   • **问题**：25名客户/分钟到达，平均等待1分钟，通话3.5分钟，求系统中平均客户数。  
   • **解答**：  
     \[
     I = R \times T = 25\ \text{人/分钟} \times (1 + 3.5)\ \text{分钟} = 112.5\ \text{人}
     \]  
   • **结论**：系统内平均有112.5名客户（等待或通话中）。  

2. **库存周转率与成本计算**  
   • **数据**：COGS = 1501美元/年，库存 = 590美元，年库存持有成本率15.25%，单位成本85美元。  
   • **计算**：  
     ◦ **库存周转率**：  
       \[
       \text{Inventory Turns} = \frac{1501}{590} \approx 2.54\ \text{次/年}
       \]  
     ◦ **单位库存成本**：  
       \[
       \text{单位成本} = \frac{15.25\%}{2.54} \times 85 \approx 5.1\ \text{美元/单位}
       \]  
   • **结论**：每单位产品库存成本为5.1美元。  

3. **员工流动率与平均任期**  
   • **数据**：平均员工数1500人，年离职500人。  
   • **计算**：  
     ◦ **流动率**：  
       \[
       \text{Turnover Rate} = \frac{500}{1500} \approx 33.3\%\ \text{（每年替换1/3员工）}
       \]  
     ◦ **离职时的平均任期**：  
       \[
       \text{Tenure on Departure} = \frac{1500}{500} = 3\ \text{年}
       \]  
     ◦ **在职员工平均任期**：  
       \[
       \text{Average Tenure} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\ \text{年}
       \]  
   • **结论**：员工平均在职1.5年，离职时平均任期3年。

### **关键结论与启示**  
1. **利特尔法则的普适性**  
   • **跨行业应用**：从库存管理、员工流动到服务流程（如医疗、航空），均可量化效率。  
   • **诊断工具价值**：通过已知两变量快速定位问题（如库存积压、员工流失率高）。  

2. **管理优化方向**  
   • **库存管理**：高周转率减少资金占用，但需平衡缺货风险（如快消品 vs. 奢侈品）；  
   • **员工流动**：低流动率提升组织稳定性，但需避免僵化（如Costco vs. 咨询公司）；  
   • **客户服务**：缩短流程时间（T）直接减少排队人数（I），提升体验。  

3. **数据驱动决策**  
   • **简化测量**：利用现有数据（如财务报表、HR记录）快速计算关键指标；  
   • **动态调整**：企业扩张时需更新平均值（如员工数、库存量），确保公式准确性。  

**最终目标**：通过**利特尔法则**将复杂运营问题转化为可量化的数学关系，实现**资源效率最大化**与**客户价值最优化**。

## 模块标题: Week 3: Little's Law

引言: 

Little's Law, a foundational concept in operations management, helps quantify and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of a system by providing key performance indicators. By understanding the relationship between inventory, arrival rate, and cycle time, managers can make informed decisions regarding capacity planning. Little’s Law also serves as a diagnostic tool for process improvement initiatives and is particularly valuable in supply chain management, where it enables companies to optimize inventory levels, reduce lead times, and enhance coordination among various stages of the supply chain. It helps strike a balance between supply and demand, improving overall responsiveness and customer service.

Learning Objectives:
- Compute employee turnover and average tenure
- Compute inventory turns and days of supply, determine the inventory costs
- Given two of the basic process flow measures, find the third using Little’s Law

### 第一章: Using Little's Law

#### 视频小节4: Module Review and Practice Problem

字幕文本: 

In this module we talked about Little's law. We use it to compute flow time given inventory and flow rate, we computed inventory turns and inventory cost and we look at the turnover of employees. In this last video of this module, I want to review the learning objectives, the key definitions and the key equations. I will then give you some opportunities to practice this new knowledge on a set of very specific practice problems. Let's start with our model review. Here are the learning objectives, I hope I brought across in this module. You should now be comfortable using Little's law to compute one of the three performance measures, I, R, and T given the other two. You should be able to do the inventory turns calculation and the employee turnover calculations. We've a bunch of new definitions. More importantly, we also have a bunch of formulas including Little's law itself. First practice problem. This is a little slow question where we have 25 callers coming in per minute. On average they are callers spend one minute on hold and 3.5 minutes talking to a service representative. Ask yourself how many callers are in the call center either on hold while talking to an agent. Put me on pause, wrestle with this by yourself, and then we'll do the problem together. Here we go. There are 25 callers arriving per minute on average. That is our flow rate R. The average caller spent one minute on hold and 3.5 minutes talking to the agent. That's offload time T. I = R *T. That's Little's law. We now have R, which is 25 calls per minute, and we have the flow time of 4.5 minutes. If we multiply those two and the minutes cancel out, and that leaves us with an inventory of hundred 12.5 callers on average. Next up we have an inventory turns problem. You'll see the following financial information here and I want you to find out the inventory turns for this company. Again, put me on pause now. Here's my shot at doing this. Drop the revenues focused on the COGS, the cost of goods sold. The revenues and the question here to just confuse you, I'm sorry. The inventory turns is COGS divided by the inventory. That is 1501 dollars per year, divided by the inventory which is expressed in dollars. The inventory we said is 590. This is not getting us to 0.54 turns per year. The units are one over years because it's turns, not years, its turns. Now, to get the inventory cost, we take the annual cost of inventory, the 15.25 per cent, and that's per year. The cost you would incur if you held the inventory for an entire year. But you're not holding it for an entire year, you're turning it to 0.54 time. Divide this by 2.54. Now you're applying this to the $85 of the item. You multiply this by $85 and this gives you roughly $5.1 per unit as a per unit inventory cost. The third and final practice problem of this module, we have a company with 1,500 employees on average, and it recruits 500 employees per year. I want you to find the employee turnover and the average tenure of the employee. Pause me now. What do we do? There are 1,500 employees on average, and on average 500 employees leave the company per year. The employee turnover is 500 employees per year divided by 1,500 employees. That is giving us a 1/3. The units for that are one over years. Again, it's a turn one over years. That gives us already a hint on the tenure on when they leave. That is a tenure on departure. On average before leaving, they're going to stay for three years. But that wasn't the question, I asked for the average tenure. For the average tenure, we have to take these three years and divide it by two. Some would be just studying and some will just be finishing their time at the company. On average, this is going to be 1.5 years. That's all I have to say for now. If you feel you're done, just get off the video. If you want to hear another Little's law story, hang on for another minute or two. A couple of years ago, I was at the Philadelphia Airport. Those were the days before we had TSA pre-check n. All passengers had to go through the same line. Believe me, it was a long line. When one day I arrived at gate B for my flight to San Francisco, I was greeted by a TSA officer who stood at the end of that long line. The officer was friendly and professional and handed me a form. This was the form, as you can see the form reads," Hello, I'm a representative of the Transportation Security Administration. TSA is a government agency responsible for making your travel secure. Please take this time stamped card and help us determine how long it takes you to get through the line." There was a little timestamp on the back of the car. You that would have been me, you have been selected because you're the last person in line. Thank you. Then it goes on to say, "Please give this card again to the line monitor at the beginning of the line. That's where we're going to timestamp it again and that allows us to compute how long you waited in line." You get it? They were measuring how long it takes me to go through security. In other words, they measure my flow time. What do you think? Is this how you would have measured flow time? Well, I didn't like it. I put on my professorial voice that I'm sure you know I have grown sick and tired of and I explained to this officer, "Look officer, why don't you simply count the number of passengers that are standing in line. That gives you your inventory. You know the flow rate, which is simply the number of passengers were boarding the airplane today and then you use Little's Law to find the flow time. Brilliant, isn't it? One of the leaves said is what I thought the officer I'm sure had his own opinion on that matter. See you in the next module.
