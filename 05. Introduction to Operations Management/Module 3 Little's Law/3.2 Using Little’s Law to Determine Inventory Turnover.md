## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块3 - 利特尔法则

### 课程3.2 使用利特尔定律确定库存周转率

通过 **利特尔法则（Little's Law）** 在库存管理中的实际应用，揭示 **库存周转率（Inventory Turns）** 与 **库存成本** 的深层关系，核心是掌握如何通过量化指标优化供应链效率与财务表现。

#### 1. 库存周转的核心指标

##### 1.1 库存周转天数（Days of Supply）  

- **公式**：库存周转天数 = （库存 / COGS）× 365  
- **意义**：衡量库存转化为销售所需时间，反映资金占用效率。  
- **案例**：  
  - **戴尔（2000年）**：库存3.91亿美元，COGS 200亿美元 → 周转天数≈7天。  
  - **康柏（2000年）**：库存20.03亿美元，COGS 252.6亿美元 → 周转天数≈29天。  

##### 1.2 库存周转次数（Inventory Turns）

- **公式**：库存周转次数 = COGS / 库存  
- **意义**：单位时间库存变现次数，次数越高效率越高。  
- **案例**：戴尔周转次数≈52次/年，康柏≈12次/年。  

#### 2. 行业对比与库存策略

##### 2.1 零售商库存周转差异

   | **零售商** | **库存周转特点**              | **周转次数（次/年）** | **原因**                          |  
   |------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|  
   | **蒂芙尼** | 低周转（慢）                   | 1                   | 高价值、长尾商品（如珠宝），需大量SKU满足个性化需求。 |  
   | **克罗格** | 高周转（快）                   | 14                  | 生鲜食品易腐，需快速周转避免损耗。            |  
   | **科尔士** | 中等周转（较快）               | 4                   | 时尚服饰需应对季节变化，但需平衡款式多样性。      |  
   | **沃尔玛** | 中等偏高（高效供应链）           | 8                   | 综合品类管理，结合食品快消与耐用品策略。        |  

##### 2.2 库存成本构成

- **资金成本**：库存占用资金的加权平均资本成本（WACC）。  
- **存储成本**：仓储、保险、安全等费用。  
- **贬值成本**：产品过时（如科技产品）、时尚淘汰（如服装）导致的减值。  
- **案例**：价值1000美元的电脑，年持有成本≈30%（300美元），周转6次 → 单件成本=300/6=50美元。  

#### 3. 关键结论与启示

##### 3.1 库存效率与利润的权衡

- **高毛利低周转（如蒂芙尼）**：通过高客单价抵消库存成本，但需承担资金积压风险。  
- **低毛利高周转（如沃尔玛）**：薄利多销依赖高效供应链，如沃尔玛周转次数8次 vs 梅西百货3次 → 单件库存成本降低3个百分点。  

##### 3.2 戴尔模式的兴衰启示

- **按订单生产（BTO）**：1980-2000年代颠覆行业，库存周转达80次/年，减少贬值风险。  
- **挑战**：消费者转向即时需求（如苹果现货模式），定制化需求下降，戴尔周转次数降至约20次。  

##### 3.3 数据驱动决策

- **动态调整库存策略**：根据市场变化（如季节性需求、技术迭代）灵活调整采购与生产节奏。  
- **技术赋能**：利用ERP系统实时监控周转率，预测需求波动，优化补货周期。  

#### 4. 行动建议

##### 4.1 计算核心指标

- 定期核算库存周转天数与次数，对标行业标杆（如零售对标沃尔玛，制造对标丰田）。  
- 公式：  
  - **周转天数** = （平均库存 / COGS）× 365  
  - **周转次数** = COGS / 平均库存  

##### 4.2 优化库存结构

- **ABC分类法**：A类（高价值低周转）精细化管控，C类（低价值高周转）批量采购。  
- **JIT策略**：按需采购，减少滞销风险（如戴尔模式）。  

##### 4.3 供应链协同  

- 与供应商共享销售数据，缩短交货周期（如克罗格与生鲜供应商的日补货协议）。  
- 引入VMI（供应商管理库存），转移库存压力。

#### 总结

利特尔法则在库存管理中的应用，揭示了 **周转即利润** 的核心逻辑：  
- **高效周转**降低资金占用与贬值风险，即使毛利率较低，仍可通过规模效应提升整体收益。  
- **行业特性决定策略**：珠宝商需平衡长尾需求与资金成本，超市需极致周转应对生鲜损耗。  
- **数据为锚**：实时监控周转指标，动态调整策略，是应对市场不确定性的关键。

## 模块标题: Week 3: Little's Law

引言: 

Little's Law, a foundational concept in operations management, helps quantify and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of a system by providing key performance indicators. By understanding the relationship between inventory, arrival rate, and cycle time, managers can make informed decisions regarding capacity planning. Little’s Law also serves as a diagnostic tool for process improvement initiatives and is particularly valuable in supply chain management, where it enables companies to optimize inventory levels, reduce lead times, and enhance coordination among various stages of the supply chain. It helps strike a balance between supply and demand, improving overall responsiveness and customer service.

Learning Objectives:
- Compute employee turnover and average tenure
- Compute inventory turns and days of supply, determine the inventory costs
- Given two of the basic process flow measures, find the third using Little’s Law

### 第一章: Using Little's Law

#### 视频小节2: Using Little’s Law to Determine Inventory Turnover

字幕文本: 

In the last video, I introduced our first equation in this course, which we refer to as Little's Law. We learned that on average, in every process, the average inventory is equal to the average flow rate times the average flow time. Today we will apply Little's Law to the world of physical inventories. For that, we will do something that first might appears really weird. We will pick an individual dollar bill as our flow unit. We will then think of a firm as a big black box in which dollar bills float in on the one side and the dollar bills flows out on the other side. We can then ask ourselves a simple question. How long does the average dollar bill spend inside the company? While clearly we cannot ask the dollar bill, hey dollar bill, how long did you spend in the company? But we don't have to. We can use Little's Law. More specifically with think of the number of dollar bills flowing through the organization as a cost of goods sold or COGS for short. The number of dollar bills inside the organization is the inventory. If you've taken accounting courses, you might ask about LIFO or FIFO for the purpose of what we're doing, it doesn't matter. Note further that we're using COGS is our flow rate. I see folks and corporate finance sometimes use revenues. Since inventory is valued and COGs dollar, I prefer to use carbs to be consistent. Let's visualize this. We have our individual dollar bill that goes into the organization, the inflow, and then we have all the dollar bills coming out. The dollar bill in the organization as the inventory. The flow of dollar bills through the organization is really our COGS. When we want to know how long does the individual dollar bill spend inside the organization. That would be the flow time COGS and inventory we can get that from accounting. Again, Little's Law is I = R*C. We are solving this for T, the flow time and that tells us how long it dollar bill spends in the organization. Sounds too abstract. Well, let's do a specific example. Let's compare two legendary computer makers, Compaq and Dell, of which of course only one exists by now. I will give you a reason why you probably are not watching this video on a Compaq computer. We're going to use Little's Law to find out how long the dollar was spent in the organization. I = R*T. We're going to solve this for T. Let's start with Dell's numbers. The inventory at Dell in 2000 was about 391 million. Again, I will start with old data. From the time when Compaq was still around. We have $20 billion a year as the flow rate, so COGS. So that is dollars per year times T. T is our unknown. We're going to solve this for T so that means 391/20000. That is expressed now in years. So the unit is years. If you want to convert the years into days, we have to multiply with 365 days in the year and that is about seven days. Dell keeps their inventory for seven days before spitting it out again. We refer to this number as days of supply. Dell has about seven days worth of supply. Whether this is a lot or not. Well, let's compare this with Compaq. In the same year, Compaq had an inventory of roughly two billion dollars, 2.003 billion to be exact, and COGS, at 25 billion. Multiply this with the flow time T. Again, we're going to solve for T, in this case is 2003/252633, then again is multiplied by 365 days a year. We see that the average dollar spends 29 days within compact. That's a very sharp contrast to Dell's number. Again, we refer to this number as a days of supply. We can read this directly as inventory divided by COGS*365. Now instead of saying we're going to keep the inventory for seven days, I can say I'm going to turn the inventory every seven days. That means at Dell I have about 52 inventory turns per year. The inventory turns is COGS divided by inventory. That tells us how many times I'm turning the inventory. It's one over the flow time T. And this was old data. I picked the date and the year so that Compaq and Dell were both still around. To take Dell's numbers into perspective, I showed you the data here from 1990 to the very recent past. On this slide here, you'll see that in the early years, this was really the rise of the Dell model. This was a revolution in the computer industry. Micro Dell's idea was that you can make your computer to order. Rather than having the computer wait in inventory for the customer, the customers waited for the computer. That went super well, that peaked at around 80 inventory turns per year in the early 2000s. The burst of the tech bubble then happened around 2001. Dell did a goods job at recovering the inventory turns, but you notice the decline starts before the financial crisis and that has never stopped. This is really down here now. Note what you see is not the financial crisis, it's really the end of the Dell model, and that has a lot to do with the fact that nowadays as customers we don't want to wait for our computers anymore and we don't ask for customized computers. The variety has gone down in the industry and now companies like Apple, it is again, computers waiting for customers. It's an irony of history, if you will. Okay, time for a little game. I call this game the inventory turns scripts. I will show you here four retailers, the jewelry maker Tiffany, the supermarket Kroger, the apparel store Kohl's and Walmart the worldwide leading retailer. Then I'll give you four levels of inventory turns and your job is to match retailer and inventory turns. Who is who? Put me on pause and give this some thought. Here we go again. Here are the solutions to the quiz. Tiffany is a lowest turns. They turn the inventory very slowly. The reason for that is they have a huge assortment, they provide you lots of choice. That means that each of these products, each of these wedding bands or necklaces, is going to wait a long time for the customer. Kroger is the other extreme. Supermarkets turn their inventory very quickly. A lot of these items that are perishable, fresh food inventories have to turn almost daily. Kohl, fashion wants to turn quickly, but not as quickly as middle. Walmart also somewhere in the middle, has a large grocery component to it, very well managed and they have pretty decent turns. Next and think about why do we care about these inventory turns? Inventory turns have something to do with inventory costs. They may do a thought experiment. Imagine you have $1,000 computer. You keep that computer for an entire year. How much will that cost you? Well over a year, that computer gets somewhat obsolete. You have to store that computer and you have to finance a computer with your weighted average cost of capital or WACC for short. Know that this is not a real out-of-pocket expense. Most of that is a write-off and an opportunity cost, but it's an important number. A thousand dollar computer I would easily say, loses $300 of value in a year. You might have to pay $100 to store it safely and securely and you might have to pay about 10% of the value of the computer in terms of opportunity cost. So those numbers add up to something pretty big. But of course, you're not holding the computer for an entire year, as we saw in the case of Dahlia turning it multiple times. So let's say for sake of argument, if that inventory costs per year number is 30% and you're turning it six times per year. That means for every unit, for every computer that you're selling, you're incurring a cost of five percentage points. That means for $60 item in terms of cost, one item that you source was $60, you would incur $3 per unit cost of inventory. A final comment on inventory cost. This graph shows the relationship between profit margins and inventory turns. Now if you look at this graph, you might wonder why I talk so much about inventory turns being good because it seems to be a negative correlation between margins and inventory turns. You see Tiffany up their was slow turns and they make big margins. You see BestBuy and Walmart down here, and they are fast turns and low margins. But that's not the point. As I said, Tiffany holds a very broad product assortment. They have a ring or wedding band for every customer who comes into a store. That means you have to hold the inventory a long time, that's low turns. But when somebody than one set rank, oh my god, will they pay. BestBuy and Walmart are much more in the fast turning business, offering customers less choice. Look at the competition here between the middle Macy's and the GAP, they're both somewhat in the same product category. Look at the situation here. Macy's turns its inventory three times in a year. GAP turns inventory four times in a year. Let's take a pair of jeans or some other apparel and assume that there are 36% cost of inventory for holding the item for an entire year. Again, that is the cost of storage, the cost of capital, and the cost of fashion becoming obsolete. That means 36% with three terms for Macy, that would be 12% unit cost versus the GAP. We turn to four times. That is a 9% unit costs. So that little difference in terms of inventory turns is worth three percentage points in terms of profit margins, right? Thus again, with the fossil turns can achieve a significant financial advantage, even though the profit margins on the book might actually slightly look lower. Today we talked about inventory turns. This is a key concept in much of inventory planning, purchasing, and supply chain management. It really captures the cost of inventory. These costs are combination of capital holding costs. That's an opportunity cost of capital, cost of storage, shrinkage and theft, as well as the cost of markdowns because of value depreciation. What I like about Little's law is that it reminds us that the only way we can efficiently support a big flaw of product in the form of big sales is by turning the inventory quickly. Some supply chain managers talk about turn and earn. I like that. Turn and earn. The more you turn your inventory, the more efficient of a supply chain you run. For now, turn off the video, you earned a break. See you in the next video.
