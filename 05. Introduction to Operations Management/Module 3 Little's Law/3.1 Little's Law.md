## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块3 - 利特尔法则

### 课程3.1 利特尔法则

聚焦于**利特尔法则（Little's Law）**，通过医院患者流案例解析流程效率的核心关系，核心是掌握库存（Inventory）、流量率（Flow Rate）与流程时间（Flow Time）的数学关联，并应用其优化运营决策。

#### 1. 利特尔法则的定义与公式

##### 1.1 公式表达

**I = R × T**  
- **I（Inventory）**：流程中的平均库存（如医院患者数量）。  
- **R（Flow Rate）**：单位时间流量率（如每日处理患者数）。  
- **T（Flow Time）**：流单元平均流程时间（如患者从进入至离开的总时间）。  

##### 1.2 核心逻辑

- 三者动态关联，任意两项确定后，第三项由公式自然推导。  
- **降低库存的唯一途径**：缩短流程时间或减少流量率（后者通常不可取）。  

#### 2. 医院案例解析

- **数据观测方法**:  
  - **累积流入曲线（蓝线）** 与**累积流出曲线（红线）** 记录患者进出时间。  
  - **库存计算**：任意时刻库存 = 累积流入数 - 累积流出数（如上午10点：4人进入 - 1人离开 = 3人在系统中）。  

- **关键指标计算**：  
  - **流量率（R）**：全天处理11名患者（若时长为8小时，则R=11/8≈1.375患者/小时）。  
  - **流程时间（T）**：患者停留时间差异显著（最短15分钟，最长数小时），需计算平均值。  
  - **库存（I）**：日内波动（0到4人），取平均库存值。  

#### 3. 利特尔法则的应用与启示

##### 3.1 运营诊断工具

- **已知两项求第三项**：  
  - 若工厂日产量（R=100件）且平均库存（I=200件），则平均流程时间T=2天。  
  - 若医院希望将候诊患者（I）从10人降至5人，需缩短平均就诊时间（T）或减少接诊量（R）。  

##### 3.2 业应用场景  
  - **制造业**：通过减少生产周期（T）降低在制品库存（I）。  
  - **零售业**：提高库存周转率（R/I）以降低仓储成本。  
  - **服务业**：缩短客户等待时间（T）提升满意度（如银行排队优化）。  

##### 3.3 实际挑战

- **流量率（R）** 易统计（如销售额、接诊量），**库存（I）** 在实物流程中较易追踪（如仓库管理系统）。  
- **流程时间（T）**常被忽视，需通过数据系统（如RFID追踪、数字排队系统）精确测量。  

#### 4. 关键结论

1. **定律普适性**：  
   Little's Law适用于任何稳定系统（流入≈流出），无论制造业、服务业或供应链。  

2. **杠杆效应**：  
   缩短流程时间是优化库存与效率的核心，而非简单限制流量。  

3. **数据驱动决策**：  
   企业需建立实时监控体系，追踪I、R、T，利用公式动态调整运营策略。  

#### 5. 行动建议

- **流程优化优先级**：识别流程时间最长的环节（如医院检查等待），针对性改进。  
- **技术赋能**：引入物联网（IoT）设备自动采集流程时间数据（如患者手环追踪）。  
- **库存控制**：根据需求波动动态调整产能（如灵活排班制），避免库存积压。  

--- 

#### 总结

利特尔法则揭示了运营效率的底层逻辑：**时间即成本，速度即竞争力**。通过量化库存、流量与时间的关系，企业可跳出局部优化陷阱，系统性提升流程效率。医院案例表明，即使复杂如医疗流程，亦可通过数据建模实现精准管理。核心在于：**以时间为锚，以数据为舵，持续驱动改进**。

## 模块标题: Week 3: Little's Law

引言: 

Little's Law, a foundational concept in operations management, helps quantify and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of a system by providing key performance indicators. By understanding the relationship between inventory, arrival rate, and cycle time, managers can make informed decisions regarding capacity planning. Little’s Law also serves as a diagnostic tool for process improvement initiatives and is particularly valuable in supply chain management, where it enables companies to optimize inventory levels, reduce lead times, and enhance coordination among various stages of the supply chain. It helps strike a balance between supply and demand, improving overall responsiveness and customer service.

Learning Objectives:
- Compute employee turnover and average tenure
- Compute inventory turns and days of supply, determine the inventory costs
- Given two of the basic process flow measures, find the third using Little’s Law

### 第一章: Using Little's Law

#### 视频小节1: Little's Law

字幕文本: 

We don't have many equations in this course, and so we should create each equation with great joy. Today I will introduce our first equation, which I will refer to as Little's Law. To illustrate the equation and to build some intuition, I will use a hospital example. A while ago, one of the interventional radiologist here at Penn, had asked me to look at their patient flow. But what do you look for when looking for patient flows? Well, imagine you and I will take two folding chairs, coffee and donuts, and make ourselves comfortable in front of Penn's Department of Interventional Radiology. We also take a notebook along and you will take detailed notes while I munch my donuts. Ready. Here we go. At 07:35 AM, the first patient shows up. That patient goes in, doors shut. That's all we see for now. I ask you to also take a graph tracking the cumulative inflow of patients in blue and the cumulative outflow in red. Ten minutes later, at 07:45 again, the next patient shows up, and at 08:10 AM, the third patient comes. Before the fourth patient shows up at 09:30 AM, however the first patient, the guy who came at 07:35 comes out of the department. At 10:00 AM, I ask you a test question. How many patients are in the unit right now? Sharp as you are, you will respond three, because four went in and one came out. From that point onwards, I stop asking my stupid questions and you just take your notes. Only Patient 5 surprises most of us as she got in and out of the department in 15 minutes. We later learn that the patient refused to sign the consent form. At the end of our day in the hospital, we have built graphs that looks something like this. Again, the blue graph captures a cumulative inflow and the red graph is a cumulative outflow. These two graphs meet at the time the last patient has left the unit. First, observe that we've taken care of 11 patients. In prior modules, we refer to this number as a flow rate, which I'm going to now abbreviate with the letter R. The flow rate measures how many patients we saw in a given period of time, in our case, one day. There are a couple of more things this graph teaches us about the patient flow. We can also compute the number of patients that are in the department at any given moment of time. This is simply the difference between the inflow curve and the outflow curve. The number fluctuates between zero in the morning and four around 03:00 PM. Remember, we define the number of flow units in the process as inventory, which I will now abbreviate with the letter I. Finally, you can also see how long a patient spent in the process. Some patients spend a long time as with patient number 9 here. Others got in and out much faster. Recall, patient 5 was in and out in 15 minutes. This was our third measure, the flow time, which I will now abbreviate with the letter T. The flow time measures how long it took for the patient to flow through the process from beginning to end. Now the reason why I'm reviewing these three definitions here, is not just because they are important. If you look at the figure here, which summarizes all observations for the day, you might see a relationship. On average, the inventory in the process is the flow rate in the process times the flow time. Inventory in this case is measured in patients. Flow rate is patients per hour, and flow time is measured in hours. In any process and at any time, the average inventory is equal to the average flow rate times the average flow time, or I=R * T for short. We will refer to this relationship as Little's Law. You see a picture of message on Little here. Dr. Little was born in 1928. But more importantly, his law says, on average, in any process inventories equal to flow rate times flow time. I've been teaching this for many years. In one of my classes, a student had a great idea how to remember the equation. He just stared at my slide and shouted out, "I, R, T". I remember that. I can't beat that. More importantly, let's talk about the implications. Little's Law reminds us that from the three most important performance measure in any process. Two, you can potentially mess around with and adjust. But once you have done this, the third one is really given by nature. But there's an easy way to get to zero inventory. You just stop producing, you said R = 0 and you get I = 0. But obviously, that's a really bad idea. If you want to get rid of some working capital, get rid of some inventory, the only way you can do this is to move the flow units faster through the process. You have to remember that flow time in inventory holding flow rate constant move proportional to each other. This is also practically very helpful. Oftentimes when you do a process analysis, say you visit a plant, you might only be able to see, to observe two of the three performance measures. Using Little's Law, you can just compute yourself the third one. Which of the three performance measures I, R, and T, do you think is the hardest one to compute in practice? Well, let's think about that. Does the company know its flow rate? How many tables it has made, how many loans it has underwritten, or how many patients it has seen? Yes. Even fairly and competent companies measure their flow rate. After all, flow rate* price=revenue. Do they know their inventory? Well, there's oftentimes this tract less carefully in the services world. In manufacturing and retailing where you typically are dealing with physical products as flow units, you need to track your inventory for accounting purposes. Service that is oftentimes not done as carefully, but still hospitals tend to know how many patients they have. This number is often times called the census. Banks or insurances sometimes strike the customers that are waiting for a loan as well. It is the flow time that is oftentimes forgotten or hard to measure. How long did I have to wait in line? How long has this customer waited for her request? To see it with Benjamin Franklin's words, lost time is never found again. Wise words, so I doubt that good old Ben had the ideal flow time in mind. Anyway, the good news is this, you can always find the average flow time as long as you have the average inventory and the average flow rate. In the next videos, we will put Little's Law to work.
