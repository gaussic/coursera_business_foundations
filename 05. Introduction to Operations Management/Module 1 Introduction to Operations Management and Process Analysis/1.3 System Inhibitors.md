### 课程1.3 系统抑制因素

聚焦于**运营管理中的三大系统抑制因素**（System Inhibitors），揭示低效根源并提出改进方向，核心是通过消除**浪费、变异性与僵化性**，提升运营效率与客户价值。

#### 1. 三大系统抑制因素的定义与影响

##### 1. 浪费（Waste） 

- **定义**：消耗资源但未为客户创造价值的活动或输入。  
- **案例与影响**：  
  - **德国军用直升机**：75架中仅9架可用，单机成本7000万美元，资源闲置造成巨额浪费。  
  - **食品与能源浪费**：美国30%-40%食品供应链浪费（价值1600亿美元）、超半数能源浪费，加剧环境负担。  
- **改进方向**：量化浪费（如测量闲置资源、损耗率），通过流程优化减少无效消耗。

##### 2. 变异性（Variability）  
 
- **定义**：需求或供应的不稳定性，导致运营波动与资源错配。  
- **案例与影响**：  
  - **需求端**：航空旅行需求因疫情、天气骤变（如费城枪击事件与天气关联的创伤中心需求波动）。  
  - **供给端**：同一医院急诊科医生处理患者时长差异显著（医生行为差异、设备故障）。  
- **改进方向**：预测需求波动（如数据分析）、标准化流程（如医疗操作规范）、增加资源缓冲（如灵活排班）。

##### 3. 僵化性（Inflexibility）

- **定义**：系统无法快速适应需求或环境变化，导致资源利用效率低下。  
- **案例与对比**：  
  - **Uber的灵活性**：动态定价与司机调度（「峰时定价」），匹配需求波动（雨天周末 vs. 工作日中午）。  
  - **汽车制造策略**：大众专注单一动力类型工厂（僵化） vs. 奔驰混线生产电动车与燃油车（混合灵活性）。  
- **改进方向**：  
  - **数量灵活性（Volume Flexibility）**：动态调整资源规模（如共享经济模式）。  
  - **混合灵活性（Mix Flexibility）**：同一流程服务多样化需求（如柔性生产线）。  

#### 3. 关键结论

##### 1. 浪费是隐形成本黑洞

- 浪费不仅消耗资金（如直升机闲置、食品损耗），更造成社会损失（如医疗资源短缺、环境破坏）。  
- **行动优先级**：建立量化指标（如资源利用率、损耗率），识别并消除非增值环节。  

##### 2. 变异性是效率的天然敌人  

- 需求端（客户行为）与供给端（资源能力）的波动共同导致产能失衡。  
- **应对策略**：通过预测工具、流程标准化和缓冲资源（如临时工、备用设备）平滑波动。  

##### 3. 僵化性限制企业适应力  

- 传统固定产能模式（如出租车牌照）难以应对需求变化，柔性运营（如Uber动态调度）是未来趋势。  
- **创新方向**：技术赋能（如AI预测需求）、组织变革（如模块化生产流程）。  

##### 4. 系统抑制因素互相关联  

- 变异性加剧浪费（如需求突降导致库存积压），僵化性放大变异性影响（如无法快速调整产能）。需综合应对。

#### 总结
 
运营管理的本质是**对抗低效**：通过消除浪费、管理变异性、增强灵活性，企业可突破效率前沿，实现成本与客户价值的双重优化。案例表明，无论是军用装备、医疗系统还是交通服务，系统抑制因素的解决需结合数据驱动、技术创新与组织变革。

## 模块标题: Week 1: Introduction to Operations Management and Process Analysis

引言: 

At its core, operations management is about finding and then reducing inefficiencies. We will start by examining key concepts such as cost-quality trade-off, the efficiency frontier, and three system inhibitors. We will also explore process analysis, enabling you to identify and analyze the steps involved in a process and make changes to improve its outcomes. By the end of this module, you will have opportunities to practice these concepts by creating process flow diagrams and calculating the resource with the lowest capacity. Additionally, you'll be able to practice calculating capacity, flow rate, and utilization. You will be able to transfer these skills to initiate process analysis within your organization.

Learning Objectives:
- Examine the drivers of good quality and high willingness-to-pay
- Identify three system inhibitors
- Define the efficiency frontier of an industry
- Map an operation as a process flow
- Compute the utilization of a resource
- Compute flow rate (and understand the definitions of inventory, flow time and flow rate)
- Compute a capacity of an individual resource and find the bottleneck in a process

### 第一章: Introduction to Operations

#### 视频小节3: System Inhibitors

字幕文本: 

In the last video, I introduced the concept of the efficiency frontier Parrado, dominance and inefficiencies. I have to confess that my definition of inefficiencies being the gap between the firm's current position and the efficiency frontier is rather academic and abstract. In today's video, I want to get more concrete. Specifically, I will define inefficiencies in the form of three system inhibitors that I will label waste variability and inflexibility. These three system inhibitors will make inefficiencies more concrete, more tangible. It is like coming down from the 30,000 foot level view of strategy and economics to the specificity of real operations. As a business owner or a management consultant, it is important to know where you stand relative to the efficiency frontier. But in order to make an improvement, you have to be more specific. You have to roll up your sleeves and tackle the inefficiencies directly. And for that, you need to know how these inefficiencies look like. Let's define the three system inhibitors one by one. Let's start with waste. Waste corresponds to all the consumption of inputs and resources that do not add value to the customers. Since waste consumes inputs and resources, waste is costly, but since it does not add value to the customer, the customer is not willing to pay for this. We have extensive discussion of waste later on in this course, but let's start with a specific example. Did you know that most of the helicopters of the German military don't fly? Germany has 75 helicopters of type NH90. Take a guess what percentage of them is flying right now. Well, from the 75, only 44 are available. The others are with the manufacturer for repair or maintenance. From these 44 that are with the military, the German Bundeswehr, only nine actually are certified to fly right now. And since helicopters only fly a couple of hours a day, chances are that right now not a single one of them is in the air. As these helicopters cost 70 million per unit, that is a waste of resources. Beyond wasting the time and availability of resources, we oftentimes see waste of input. The FDA estimates that some 30% to 40% of American food supplies get wasted in the supply chain. That corresponds to $160,000,000,000, not to mention those who don't have access to healthy food. Even worse, it is estimated that well over half of the energy used in this country is wasted. You see this in the school visualization of researchers here at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Again, we're talking about a waste that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and massive impacts on the environment just because of waste. As we will see in this course, just measuring and quantifying this waste is already a first step towards reducing it. For now, keep in mind that waste is a consumption of inputs and resources that do not add value to the customers. Next, let's look at variability. Variability corresponds to changes in either demand or supply over time. Consider variability associated with customer demand first. Here, you see the demand for air travel in the United States starting in the spring of 2019. Given the COVID pandemic, demand for air travel plummeted. Even short of pandemics, consumer demand changes rapidly. Fashion trends, new technologies, consumer confidence, or even the weather. Demand for products or services goes up and down all the time. As an example, close to home here in Philadelphia, consider the frequencies of shootings in our city. Sadly, this translates into demands for our emergency rooms and trauma centers. You see here the variation on a monthly basis. There's also an effect of weather. My friends working in Penn's Have a very cynical view to this. When the weather turns nice, people are out in the street and more people get shot. Add to this the extra demand coming from motorcycle accidents, and you know that when the trauma bays are filling up if the weather is nice. Variability also plays out on the supply side. Take a look at this graph here of Physicians. All of them work in the same And all of them are dealing with very similar type of patients. However, as my colleague Hami Song showed in a study, the way these doctors dealt with these patients was very different from each other. In the study, Hami looked at how long patients were kept in the emergency room, a number that is known as a length of stay. You see here that some doctors kept their patients dramatically longer than others. I'm not judging their behavior, I'm just observing that they exist variability across providers. Add to this that doctors or any resource might get fatigued, machines might break down, and you have more variability from the supply side than you like. So variability comes from demand and from supply. Either way, variability is mostly a bad thing. As we saw with variability, demand can move quickly. Unfortunately, supply does not. Supply that means factories, lawyers, buildings, MRI machines and other resources. Those resources cannot quickly be added, only then to be taken away later. That gets me to my third system inhibitor, and that is inflexibility. One of the reasons why the mobility company Uber has been so successful is the ability to adjust their driving capacity to the changing customer demand. If demand is high, prices go up and some more drivers join the market. Uber calls this search pricing. If demand is low, prices come down. Unlike cabs, Uber drivers don't pay pricey medallions and so they can just do something else rather than having to compete for the same few customers in the market. You see the results here in this graph. Uber and the other ride hailing companies are able to flex the number of rides they provide. Demand for rides vary predictably over the course of the week. The sooner you can predict this extra demand for rides, the better you can drum up the drivers that you need to respond to this. More drivers are needed on a rainy Saturday night than on a Sunday Tuesday at noon. And you might like Uber and Lyft or not, they do a decent job with a virtual fleet to provide that capacity just when it is needed. This is referred to as volume flexibility. Another form of flexibility relates to having operations be able to serve different types of customers with the same process. As you will see over the duration of this course, I have an interest in electric cars. Teslas are, of course, made in factories that only produce electric cars. But how about car companies that sell both combustion engine cars as well as electric cars? Volkswagen, for example, has decided to have their factories focus on one engine type. The German Svico plant is entirely focused on electric mobility. In contrast, most of the Volkswagen plants are focused on combustion engines. Contrast this to Mercedes. Mercedes has, for the better for the worse, initially decided to mix their electric production with their combustion engine cars. The same assembly line, on the same day, even at the same time as a mix of electric and non-electric cars. Being able to use machines or workers for different purposes offers a second form of flexibility. I call this mix flexibility. So inflexibility prevents our operation to effectively respond to variability, and hence we call it our search system inhibitor. So these are the three system inhibitors waste, variability and inflexibility. The costs of these forces are beyond what you and I can imagine. In large global industries, we're talking about billions of dollars. But you know what? Personally, I couldn't care less about that money. The real costs for society are much bigger than that. The financial numbers typically reported don't include the anxiety of a patient who does not have access to care. The missed opportunities that a child has because it doesn't get high quality education, or the damage that we do to our planet because of wasting resources in our food and energy supply chains. At the risk of becoming a bit evangelical here, let me say this the promise of operations management is this. We can improve the way people work by fighting the evil effects of waste, variability and inflexibility. And that is always a good thing. Now, before I let you go, for every module, I want to get into the habit of defining the learning objectives. So you can test at the end of the module whether you accomplished what I wanted you to get done in the module. So in this module, we talked about the drivers of willingness to pay. We talked about the efficiency frontier and the three system inhibitors. A couple of key definitions, but no equations yet. But don't get used to that. That will soon change. See you in the next module.
