### 核心概念与框架  
1. **三大系统抑制因素（Three System Inhibitors）**  
   • **浪费（Waste）**：消耗资源但未创造客户价值的活动。  
     ◦ **表现**：资源闲置（如德国军用直升机仅9/75架可用）、供应链损耗（美国食品浪费达30%-40%）、能源浪费（超半数能源未被有效利用）。  
     ◦ **本质**：客户不愿为无效资源买单，且浪费推高成本。  

   • **变异性（Variability）**：需求或供应的不可预测波动。  
     ◦ **需求端**：如航空需求因疫情骤降、枪击事件导致急诊需求波动、季节性天气影响创伤中心负荷。  
     ◦ **供应端**：医生诊疗时间差异、机器故障、员工疲劳导致的效率波动。  

   • **不灵活性（Inflexibility）**：系统无法快速适应变化。  
     ◦ **容量不灵活**：传统出租车需固定牌照，无法像Uber通过“动态定价”灵活调度司机应对需求高峰。  
     ◦ **混合生产不灵活**：大众分工厂生产燃油车/电动车，而奔驰在同一产线混产，后者需更高灵活性。  

2. **抑制因素的相互作用**  
   • 变异性与不灵活性形成恶性循环：需求波动时，僵化系统无法调整资源，加剧浪费（如闲置产能或加班成本）。  
   • 浪费放大变异性影响：低效资源利用导致供需失衡时修复成本更高。

### 案例分析与社会影响  
3. **浪费的代价**  
   • **经济成本**：德国直升机浪费（单架7000万美元）、美国食品浪费（1600亿美元/年）、能源浪费（数百亿美元）。  
   • **社会成本**：医疗资源不足导致患者焦虑、教育资源不均限制儿童发展、环境破坏（食品/能源浪费加剧碳排放）。  

4. **变异性管理实践**  
   • **Uber案例**：通过动态定价和“虚拟车队”实现**容量灵活性**，匹配需求波动（如雨天夜间增派司机）。  
   • **医疗系统挑战**：急诊需求不可预测，但固定床位和医生排班导致资源错配。  

5. **灵活性的战略价值**  
   • **汽车制造业对比**：  
     ◦ 大众：分工厂生产不同类型车辆（牺牲灵活性换取专业化效率）。  
     ◦ 奔驰：同一产线混产燃油车/电动车（牺牲短期效率换取长期市场适应力）。

### 关键结论  
1. **系统抑制因素是低效的核心根源**：  
   • 浪费、变异性、不灵活性共同阻碍企业向效率边界靠近，导致成本上升与客户价值下降。  

2. **量化与改进路径**：  
   • **测量优先**：识别浪费（如直升机可用率）、变异性（需求波动统计）、不灵活性（产能调整周期）。  
   • **工具应用**：  
     ◦ 精益管理（减少浪费）、六西格玛（控制变异性）、敏捷运营（提升灵活性）。  

3. **社会责任的延伸**：  
   • 运营管理不仅关乎企业利润，更需解决资源浪费的环境影响、公共服务（医疗/教育）可及性等社会问题。  

4. **动态平衡策略**：  
   • 企业需在**专业化效率**（如大众分工厂）与**混合灵活性**（如奔驰产线）间权衡，根据行业特性选择最优路径。  

5. **技术赋能**：  
   • 数字化工具（如Uber算法调度、AI预测需求）是应对变异性与不灵活性的关键，推动实时资源优化。  

**最终目标**：通过消除三大抑制因素，企业可突破传统效率边界，实现**更低成本、更高客户价值、更可持续的运营模式**。

## 模块标题: Week 5: Introduction to Operations Management and Process Analysis

引言: 

At its core, operations management is about finding and then reducing inefficiencies. We will start by examining key concepts such as cost-quality trade-off, the efficiency frontier, and three system inhibitors. We will also explore process analysis, enabling you to identify and analyze the steps involved in a process and make changes to improve its outcomes. By the end of this module, you will have opportunities to practice these concepts by creating process flow diagrams and calculating the resource with the lowest capacity. Additionally, you'll be able to practice calculating capacity, flow rate, and utilization. You will be able to transfer these skills to initiate process analysis within your organization.

Learning Objectives:
- Examine the drivers of good quality and high willingness-to-pay
- Identify three system inhibitors
- Define the efficiency frontier of an industry
- Map an operation as a process flow
- Compute the utilization of a resource
- Compute flow rate (and understand the definitions of inventory, flow time and flow rate)
- Compute a capacity of an individual resource and find the bottleneck in a process

### 第一章: Introduction to Operations

#### 视频小节3: System Inhibitors

字幕文本: 

In the last video, I introduced the concept of the efficiency frontier Parrado, dominance and inefficiencies. I have to confess that my definition of inefficiencies being the gap between the firm's current position and the efficiency frontier is rather academic and abstract. In today's video, I want to get more concrete. Specifically, I will define inefficiencies in the form of three system inhibitors that I will label waste variability and inflexibility. These three system inhibitors will make inefficiencies more concrete, more tangible. It is like coming down from the 30,000 foot level view of strategy and economics to the specificity of real operations. As a business owner or a management consultant, it is important to know where you stand relative to the efficiency frontier. But in order to make an improvement, you have to be more specific. You have to roll up your sleeves and tackle the inefficiencies directly. And for that, you need to know how these inefficiencies look like. Let's define the three system inhibitors one by one. Let's start with waste. Waste corresponds to all the consumption of inputs and resources that do not add value to the customers. Since waste consumes inputs and resources, waste is costly, but since it does not add value to the customer, the customer is not willing to pay for this. We have extensive discussion of waste later on in this course, but let's start with a specific example. Did you know that most of the helicopters of the German military don't fly? Germany has 75 helicopters of type NH90. Take a guess what percentage of them is flying right now. Well, from the 75, only 44 are available. The others are with the manufacturer for repair or maintenance. From these 44 that are with the military, the German Bundeswehr, only nine actually are certified to fly right now. And since helicopters only fly a couple of hours a day, chances are that right now not a single one of them is in the air. As these helicopters cost 70 million per unit, that is a waste of resources. Beyond wasting the time and availability of resources, we oftentimes see waste of input. The FDA estimates that some 30% to 40% of American food supplies get wasted in the supply chain. That corresponds to $160,000,000,000, not to mention those who don't have access to healthy food. Even worse, it is estimated that well over half of the energy used in this country is wasted. You see this in the school visualization of researchers here at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Again, we're talking about a waste that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and massive impacts on the environment just because of waste. As we will see in this course, just measuring and quantifying this waste is already a first step towards reducing it. For now, keep in mind that waste is a consumption of inputs and resources that do not add value to the customers. Next, let's look at variability. Variability corresponds to changes in either demand or supply over time. Consider variability associated with customer demand first. Here, you see the demand for air travel in the United States starting in the spring of 2019. Given the COVID pandemic, demand for air travel plummeted. Even short of pandemics, consumer demand changes rapidly. Fashion trends, new technologies, consumer confidence, or even the weather. Demand for products or services goes up and down all the time. As an example, close to home here in Philadelphia, consider the frequencies of shootings in our city. Sadly, this translates into demands for our emergency rooms and trauma centers. You see here the variation on a monthly basis. There's also an effect of weather. My friends working in Penn's Have a very cynical view to this. When the weather turns nice, people are out in the street and more people get shot. Add to this the extra demand coming from motorcycle accidents, and you know that when the trauma bays are filling up if the weather is nice. Variability also plays out on the supply side. Take a look at this graph here of Physicians. All of them work in the same And all of them are dealing with very similar type of patients. However, as my colleague Hami Song showed in a study, the way these doctors dealt with these patients was very different from each other. In the study, Hami looked at how long patients were kept in the emergency room, a number that is known as a length of stay. You see here that some doctors kept their patients dramatically longer than others. I'm not judging their behavior, I'm just observing that they exist variability across providers. Add to this that doctors or any resource might get fatigued, machines might break down, and you have more variability from the supply side than you like. So variability comes from demand and from supply. Either way, variability is mostly a bad thing. As we saw with variability, demand can move quickly. Unfortunately, supply does not. Supply that means factories, lawyers, buildings, MRI machines and other resources. Those resources cannot quickly be added, only then to be taken away later. That gets me to my third system inhibitor, and that is inflexibility. One of the reasons why the mobility company Uber has been so successful is the ability to adjust their driving capacity to the changing customer demand. If demand is high, prices go up and some more drivers join the market. Uber calls this search pricing. If demand is low, prices come down. Unlike cabs, Uber drivers don't pay pricey medallions and so they can just do something else rather than having to compete for the same few customers in the market. You see the results here in this graph. Uber and the other ride hailing companies are able to flex the number of rides they provide. Demand for rides vary predictably over the course of the week. The sooner you can predict this extra demand for rides, the better you can drum up the drivers that you need to respond to this. More drivers are needed on a rainy Saturday night than on a Sunday Tuesday at noon. And you might like Uber and Lyft or not, they do a decent job with a virtual fleet to provide that capacity just when it is needed. This is referred to as volume flexibility. Another form of flexibility relates to having operations be able to serve different types of customers with the same process. As you will see over the duration of this course, I have an interest in electric cars. Teslas are, of course, made in factories that only produce electric cars. But how about car companies that sell both combustion engine cars as well as electric cars? Volkswagen, for example, has decided to have their factories focus on one engine type. The German Svico plant is entirely focused on electric mobility. In contrast, most of the Volkswagen plants are focused on combustion engines. Contrast this to Mercedes. Mercedes has, for the better for the worse, initially decided to mix their electric production with their combustion engine cars. The same assembly line, on the same day, even at the same time as a mix of electric and non-electric cars. Being able to use machines or workers for different purposes offers a second form of flexibility. I call this mix flexibility. So inflexibility prevents our operation to effectively respond to variability, and hence we call it our search system inhibitor. So these are the three system inhibitors waste, variability and inflexibility. The costs of these forces are beyond what you and I can imagine. In large global industries, we're talking about billions of dollars. But you know what? Personally, I couldn't care less about that money. The real costs for society are much bigger than that. The financial numbers typically reported don't include the anxiety of a patient who does not have access to care. The missed opportunities that a child has because it doesn't get high quality education, or the damage that we do to our planet because of wasting resources in our food and energy supply chains. At the risk of becoming a bit evangelical here, let me say this the promise of operations management is this. We can improve the way people work by fighting the evil effects of waste, variability and inflexibility. And that is always a good thing. Now, before I let you go, for every module, I want to get into the habit of defining the learning objectives. So you can test at the end of the module whether you accomplished what I wanted you to get done in the module. So in this module, we talked about the drivers of willingness to pay. We talked about the efficiency frontier and the three system inhibitors. A couple of key definitions, but no equations yet. But don't get used to that. That will soon change. See you in the next module.
