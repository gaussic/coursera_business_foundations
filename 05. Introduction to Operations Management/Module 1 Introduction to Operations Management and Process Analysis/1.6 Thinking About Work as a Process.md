## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块1 - 运营管理与流程分析

### 课程1.6 将工作视为流程  

通过**牙科诊所案例**，整合流程分析的**资源视角**与**流单元视角**，并实践关键指标计算（容量、瓶颈、利用率），核心是掌握流程分析的动态视角与实际应用。

#### 1. 流程分析的双重视角

##### 1.1 资源视角（Resource Perspective）  

- **定义**：关注单一资源（如工人、机器）如何持续处理多个流单元。  
- **案例**：  
  - **汽车装配线工人**：每分钟安装座椅，重复性操作体现资源容量（产能=1/处理时间）。  
  - **放射科医生**：每15分钟诊断一个影像，体现资源利用率与瓶颈可能性。  
- **丰田「粉笔圈」观察法**：通过现场观察（如工人站在粉笔圈内）识别浪费与低效。  

##### 1.2 流单元视角（Flow Unit Perspective）  

- **定义**：追踪单个流单元（如患者、汽车）在流程中的旅程。  
- **案例**：特斯拉汽车装配线视频展示金属板如何逐步变为整车，体现流单元经历的**流程时间**（包括等待与处理时间）。  

##### 1.3 流程图的整合作用

- **可视化双重视角**：流程图同时展示资源容量（方框）与流单元路径（箭头与三角形库存）。  
- **动态平衡**：资源处理流单元的速度需与流单元到达速度匹配，否则形成库存（如排队患者或待售汽车）。  

#### 2. 库存的两种形态

##### 2.1 实物库存（Physical Inventory）

- **定义**：未售出产品堆积（如传统车企的60-80天库存）。  
- **案例**：特斯拉早期因产能不足，客户等待数月交付（客户作为流单元形成「需求库存」）。  

##### 2.2 服务库存（Service Inventory）

- **定义**：等待服务的客户队列（如牙科诊所候诊患者）。  
- **特殊性**：服务无法预生产（如心脏手术），库存仅能表现为等待客户。  

#### 3. 牙科诊所案例实践

##### 3.1 流程图绘制 

- **流程步骤**：自助登记（Kiosk）→ 接待员 → 牙科助理 → 牙医 → 结束。  
- **缓冲区（三角形）**：各步骤前的患者等待队列。  

##### 3.2 关键指标计算

- **牙医容量**：10名牙医，每人30分钟/患者 → 容量=10/(30分钟)=20患者/小时。  
- **瓶颈识别**：对比各资源容量：  
  - 自助登记：1台设备，2分钟/患者 → 30患者/小时。  
  - 接待员：2人，5分钟/患者 → 24患者/小时。  
  - **牙科助理**：3人，15分钟/患者 → **12患者/小时（瓶颈）**。  
- **流量率（Flow Rate）**：由瓶颈决定（12患者/小时）。  
- **接待员利用率**：流量率/接待员容量=12/24=50%。  

#### 4. 关键结论与启示

- **瓶颈的动态性**
  - 瓶颈可能随需求变化转移（如患者激增时，自助登记或接待员可能成为新瓶颈）。  
- **服务行业的库存管理**  
  - 缩短等待时间（流程时间）可减少客户流失（如特斯拉通过提升产能降低交付等待）。  
- **数据驱动优化**  
  - 定期计算资源利用率（如牙医利用率=实际接诊/理论最大接诊），识别低效环节。  

#### 5. 行动建议

- **多视角分析**：  
  - **资源视角**：定期评估各岗位处理时间与容量。  
  - **流单元视角**：跟踪客户旅程（如就诊全程时间），识别冗余等待。  
- **动态调整瓶颈**：  
  - 需求高峰时，临时增加瓶颈资源（如调配更多牙科助理）。  
  - 长期优化：通过技术（如自动化登记）或流程重组（如并行处理步骤）扩容。  
- **库存控制**：  
  - 设置最大等待阈值（如候诊患者≤5人），触发资源调配机制。

#### 总结

流程分析通过双重视角揭示运营全貌：资源视角聚焦效率提升，流单元视角优化客户体验。牙科诊所案例表明，即使非技术密集型服务行业，亦可通过量化指标（容量、瓶颈、利用率）实现精准管理，核心在于动态平衡资源与需求，持续消除低效。

## 模块标题: Week 5: Introduction to Operations Management and Process Analysis

引言: 

At its core, operations management is about finding and then reducing inefficiencies. We will start by examining key concepts such as cost-quality trade-off, the efficiency frontier, and three system inhibitors. We will also explore process analysis, enabling you to identify and analyze the steps involved in a process and make changes to improve its outcomes. By the end of this module, you will have opportunities to practice these concepts by creating process flow diagrams and calculating the resource with the lowest capacity. Additionally, you'll be able to practice calculating capacity, flow rate, and utilization. You will be able to transfer these skills to initiate process analysis within your organization.

Learning Objectives:
- Examine the drivers of good quality and high willingness-to-pay
- Identify three system inhibitors
- Define the efficiency frontier of an industry
- Map an operation as a process flow
- Compute the utilization of a resource
- Compute flow rate (and understand the definitions of inventory, flow time and flow rate)
- Compute a capacity of an individual resource and find the bottleneck in a process

### 第二章: Process Analysis

#### 视频小节3: Thinking About Work as a Process

字幕文本: 

In this video, I want to tie up a couple of loose things related to process analysis. I first want to explain how process analysis and the process flow diagram help us reconcile two perspectives through an operation. The perspective of the flow unit, which likely will be handled by multiple research as its journeying through the process. As a perspective of a resource, which likely receive many flow units over time. Then I want to give you the opportunity to practice a definition we introduced so far with a little practice problem. Here we go. First, imagine you work in an auto plant and you are the person who puts in the seat into the car. Really, every minute or two, a new car arrives on the assembly line and you repeat your operation. You put in that seat. You do this over and over and over again. Similarly, you might be working in the radiology department. Every 15 minutes or so, an image of a body part comes in. You diagnose, you read the image, you put together a report, and then the next patient comes. This is a view of a resource in the process. Let's simply call it a resource's perspective. As a resource, you have a capacity, you have a utilization, and you might even be the bottleneck. Taiichi Ohno is known as the father of the Toyota Production System and it's clearly one of the most influential thinkers in operations management. He would famously draw a chalk circle on a piece of the factory floor, and his students would have to stand in this chalk circle and they will have to observe the process. Owner would check in on them and ask them to report their observations. If they are not seeing the waste and inefficiencies that Ohno wanted them to see, they will just keep on standing in the chalk circle. I hope you very much appreciate that in my course, all you have to do is watch some videos rather than spending your day n a chalk circle. Contrast the resource's perspective with the flow units perspective. As a patient, you're very likely to experience a flow unit perspective when you went to an episode of care such as in a genealogy appointment. To show you the example of the flow unit's perspective in an automotive assembly process, take a look at the video from Tesla that I found on YouTube. Really what you're doing is you're attaching yourself to the flow unit and then you flow along, you flow through the process. You'll see one resource after the other, and by making your journey through the assembly line, you start really in this case, is a piece of metal and then you go through the process and step-by-step the flow goes on, you spend your flow time and the amount of time it takes you to go through the process here with the resources, and at the end of the process, you complete the process and you have turned into a wonderful car. There you go. Now the beauty of process analysis is that it combines both the perspective of the flow unit and the perspective of the resource, all in one diagonal. Here's a simplified process flow diagram from a Tesla plant. You can read that process flow diagram with the eyes on the flow units and on flow time, the journey through the plan, or you can take the perspective of a particular resource like the paint shop and you just focus on that capacity. Whatever perspective you're taking, you will have to deal with inventory. Remember from before, inventory is the number of flow units in the system. Inventory pass up whenever demand and supply don't match. Since demand is moving quickly, our supplier is typically slow to adjust. You either have too much demand or you have too much supply. Now at the risk of creating some confusion, inventory in the car example, it can be a pile of cars waiting for a demand. Historically, for most car companies that has been the default, most car companies carry about 60-80 days of inventory in their lot. But in my framework, it can also be a number of customers waiting for a car. Tesla, for example, had hundreds of thousands of customers waiting for the Module 3, I was one of them. Later on, they had hundreds of thousands of people waiting for the cyber truck. If we define the customer as a flow unit, the number of customers waiting for their cars is simply inventory. Again, I know it's a little bit confusing because it's different from accounting. Not that operations is right and accounting as wrong, it is a different way of looking at the world, including inventory. In making physical stuff, you can have an inventory reflecting waiting stuff, rigids, cars, iPhones, whatever you're producing, or you can have waiting customers. When you're dealing with a service operations however, you can only have one scenario. For all practical purposes, it's impossible to produce a heart surgery into inventory. You also cannot have an investment discussion with your clients before the client actually shows up. In a service operation, inventory always really relates to waiting customers. Given that we're at the end of a module, it's a good time to review what we have done so far in this module. We worked through a ton of definitions from floor unit of a processing time, so capacity, all the way to my favorite three; flow rate, flow time, and inventory. More importantly, I want you to, at this point, be capable, competent, and confident to do the following. You should be able to map out an operation as a process flow, find the capacity of an individual resource, and then find the bottleneck in a process. You should also be able to compute the flow rate as a minimum of demand and capacity and find the utilization of a resource. For that, these three definitions and equations at the bottom of the slide will come in handy, as we're going to see in the first practice problem that we're about to tackle together in a couple of seconds. For this module, I've done enough of the talking, it is your time to do some work. What I want you to do is I'm going to show you a practice problem, and I'll give you time to wrestle with it. You simply read the problem, stop the video, see if you can find the solutions to the questions, and then you press "Play" again to see me solve the problem. This practice problem here describes the patient flow in a dental practice in Philadelphia. See if you can answer the following questions. Put me on pause now. Let's take a look at this together. Let's do the process flow diagram first. We start out by drawing a little triangle, this inventory of patients who need to self-check in at the kiosk. From there, we have a bunch of other steps. First, another triangle, where the patients are waiting for the receptionist. Right now we have no clue where the bottleneck might be. Let's put a buffer here just in case, then a box, another triangle just before the dental assistant. I hope you get the basic idea. Last triangle before the dentist, then comes the dentist. I don't know what you do after seeing the dentist, but I typically go home, so no triangle of completed patients but if for whatever reason we want to have people still recovering from their pain, we could have another triangle of boxes of recovery area. That's the end of the process flow diagram. Next, is what is the capacity of the dentist? The dentist is a resource and the capacity of the resource is n, the number of dentists, divided by the processing time. We have 10 dentists and each of them takes 30 minutes to see one patient, so just 10/30, and that is expressed in patients per minute, 1/3 of a patient per minute. If you want to translate this into hours, we multiply this by 60 minutes in an hour. The minutes cancel out, and we're at 20 patients per hour in terms of the capacity. What's the bottleneck in the process? The bottleneck is the resource with the lowest capacity. We have to look at the minimum of these capacities. The first capacity is 1/2 at the kiosk. One resource, m = 1/2 minutes, and it's 2/5, and then we get 3/15.

Then finally, as we just computed, 10/30 for the dentist. The lowest one of those will point us to the location of the bottleneck and that is 3/15; 3/15 is 1/5. Again, this is expressed in patients per minute. This corresponds to 12 patients per hour as a bottleneck capacity and that means that's the capacity of the entire process. Flow rate, remember, is a minimum of demand and capacity. Minimum of demand and capacity here, meaning there are plenty of patients who want our service. If demand is unlimited, of course, unlimited is a really big number. Then the minimum thereby is 12 patients per hour, which was our process capacity. Finally, what's utilization at the resource of the receptionist? Remember, in general, when we think about utilization, we think about the ratio between the flow rate, how much is a process producing, and the capacity of how much could the process be computing if it went all out. The utilization is flow rate divided by capacity. In this case here that is 12 patients per hour, which was our flow rate determined by the bottleneck, divided by the capacity of the receptionist, which is 2/5 patients per minute or 24 patients per hour. Thus the utilization of the receptionist is 50%. By now I'm sure you're getting comfortable with the idea of capacities, utilization, bottlenecks, and my three favorite measures; inventory, flow rate, and flow time. This is really the foundation for any good process analysis. In the next set of videos, I will start building on this foundation. We will add a number of diagnostic performance measures, and from there, we'll start thinking about the first set of operational improvements. See you in the next module.
