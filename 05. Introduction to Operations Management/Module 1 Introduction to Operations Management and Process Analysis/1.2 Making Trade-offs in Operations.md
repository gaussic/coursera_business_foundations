## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块1 - 运营管理与流程分析

### 课程1.2 在运营中做出权衡

聚焦于**运营中的成本与质量权衡**，核心是通过理解**效率前沿（Efficiency Frontier）** 和消除低效，实现客户支付意愿（WTP）与成本控制的平衡。


#### 1. 核心概念与框架

##### 1. 成本-质量权衡（Cost-Quality Trade-off）

- **核心矛盾**：提高客户支付意愿（如缩短等待时间、提升服务质量）通常会增加成本；降低成本则可能牺牲客户体验。  
- **案例对比**：  
  - **卡塔尔航空**：高WTP（舒适体验、优质服务）对应高成本。 
  - **瑞安航空**：低成本（廉价机票）但牺牲服务质量和体验。  

##### 2. 效率前沿（Efficiency Frontier）  

- **定义**：行业内所有企业的最优成本-质量组合形成的边界曲线，代表「无帕累托改进空间」的运营状态（即无法在不牺牲一方的情况下优化另一方）。  
- **关键意义**：  
  - 若企业处于效率前沿下方（如呼叫中心案例），说明存在低效，可通过优化同时提升质量并降低成本（帕累托改进）。  
  - 若企业处于效率前沿上，需通过技术创新或模式突破才能进一步优化。  

##### 3. 帕累托支配（Pareto Dominance）

- 若企业A在成本和质量上均优于企业B，则A帕累托支配B。企业应通过消除低效避免被支配。  

#### 2. 关键工具与分析方法

##### 1. 成本-质量坐标图

- **横轴**：成本效率（成本越低，位置越右）。  
- **纵轴**：服务质量（如响应速度越快，位置越高）。  
- **应用**：通过行业对标（如航空公司数据），识别企业当前位置与效率前沿的距离。  

##### 2. 案例分析：呼叫中心优化

- **现状**：某呼叫中心响应时间长且成本高（位于效率前沿下方）。  
- **优化方向**：  
  - **短期改进**：增加客服人员（缩短等待时间，但成本上升）。  
  - **长期优化**：通过技术或流程创新（如AI客服系统），同时降低成本和缩短响应时间，向效率前沿移动。  

#### 3. 实际应用与行业对标

##### 1. 航空公司数据解读  

- **高WTP航空（如卡塔尔航空）**：高收入/乘客英里（Yield）对应高运营成本。  
- **低成本航空（如瑞安航空）**：低Yield但运营成本极低。  
- **效率前沿分析**：通过数据分布识别行业内最优成本-质量组合，指导企业定位与竞争策略。  

##### 2. 企业定位与战略选择

- **高WTP策略**：适用于差异化市场（如高端客户）。  
- **低成本策略**：适用于价格敏感市场（如大众客户）。  
- **突破效率前沿**：需通过技术创新（如自动化、流程再造）或商业模式创新（如共享资源）。

#### **关键结论**

1. **运营管理的核心挑战**是平衡**成本效率**与**客户支付意愿**，而非单一维度的优化。  
2. **效率前沿**是衡量企业竞争力的关键工具，处于前沿下方意味着存在可消除的低效空间。  
3. **帕累托改进**：通过消除低效，可同时提升质量并降低成本（如呼叫中心案例）。  
4. **行业对标**帮助企业识别自身位置，明确优化方向（如对标航空公司数据）。  
5. **战略选择**需基于市场定位：高WTP或低成本，二者不可兼得，除非突破效率前沿。

## 模块标题: Week 1: Introduction to Operations Management and Process Analysis

引言: 

At its core, operations management is about finding and then reducing inefficiencies. We will start by examining key concepts such as cost-quality trade-off, the efficiency frontier, and three system inhibitors. We will also explore process analysis, enabling you to identify and analyze the steps involved in a process and make changes to improve its outcomes. By the end of this module, you will have opportunities to practice these concepts by creating process flow diagrams and calculating the resource with the lowest capacity. Additionally, you'll be able to practice calculating capacity, flow rate, and utilization. You will be able to transfer these skills to initiate process analysis within your organization.

Learning Objectives:
- Examine the drivers of good quality and high willingness-to-pay
- Identify three system inhibitors
- Define the efficiency frontier of an industry
- Map an operation as a process flow
- Compute the utilization of a resource
- Compute flow rate (and understand the definitions of inventory, flow time and flow rate)
- Compute a capacity of an individual resource and find the bottleneck in a process

### 第一章: Introduction to Operations

#### 视频小节2: Making Trade-offs in Operations

字幕文本: 

In the last video, we talked about what it takes to delight the customer. We talked about inconvenience, which is driven by waiting times and undesirable locations. And we talked about consumption, utility driven by the subdimensions of fit with personal preferences, and another subdimension related to various elements of quality. Let me again start today's video with a personal story. Last year I worked with a client in the Middle East, it was my first trip to the Middle East, and it was a very short trip, it was only three days long. Given this time pressure, I tried to combine my work during the day with at least a little bit of sightseeing in the evenings. Add to this a time difference, and you will understand that I was totally exhausted when I entered the plane taking me back from Doha to New York. Now, I was fortunate that my client was generous enough paying for a business class ticket on Qatar Airways. I had a wonderful breakfast, slept for 10 hours straight in something almost as comfortable as my bed at home, had another meal, checked my email, and landed in New York. What an amazing experience.

For those of us who have been on an Easyjet or Ryanair flight, we know that that experience there is very different from this. You're squeezed into a cabin, there's no space for your luggage, and the crew certainly treats you differently from a luxury airline. But I tell you, flights from England to Spain are cheaper than a dinner in a good Philly restaurant. From an operational perspective, which airline is better? The high willingness to pay airline like Qatar or the cheap service from Ryanair? On this slide, I've compiled some data from big global airlines. Airlines in the United States are regulated, and so you can get access to pretty cool operational data for simplicity, here I focus only on two variables per airline. The yield of the airline is determined by the revenues of the airline, divided by the total passenger miles the airline has provided. Please forget the term yield after this slide, it has a very different meaning in the context of operations management, not to mention yields in finance. What matters here is that really yield captures how much a customer is willing to pay for a mile of travel. I also report the operating expense of the airline. Here, I simply look at all the operating expenses related to the passenger travel and again divide them by the total passenger miles. What I want you to do is to pause the video for a minute and ask yourself, which of these airlines fit with each of these data points? Who is who? Okay, stop me now. All right, welcome back, here are the results of your exam. Did you get it right? We'll get back to the airline data in a moment, for now, let's just observe the following. An airline can provide great services and can compete on quality, aiming for a high willingness to pay. If they do this well, they can get away with somewhat higher costs. But an airline can also focus on efficiency, if the airline manages its cost well, it can be profitable even if it offers super competitive and low prices. If you take a course on strategy or marketing, you will learn a number of tools to help you in this tradeoff between cost and quality. In this course, I want to take a slightly different perspective, every individual firm faces a tradeoff between cost and willingness to pay. Let's call this a cost quality tradeoff. Consider the following example the German railway system is going through some operational transformation and trust me, they need it. One of the areas they're working on is their call center operations. If you think about willingness to pay in a call center, waiting time is an important subdimension. Who likes to wait, listening to bit of music? Imagine their current performance is here, this is their waiting time and this is their full impediment costs, measured in dollars or euros per call. Now it is really easy to run a call center with short waiting times, you just hire an extra 100 customer service representatives and the waiting time is going to come down. Unfortunately, while your waiting times go down, your fulfillment costs, your cost per call, are going up. Note here that I've reversed the axis, shorter waiting times means more responsive, which means further up on the y axis, lower fulfillment costs means more efficiency, which means further to the right on the x axis. Vice versa, it is really easy to cut costs in a call center just reduce the headcount and have fewer agents in the seat. That will reduce the cost per call, but it will obviously lead to a worse service, as customers will have to wait longer, again, as a trade off, one way to think of operations management is as a strategy implementation tool. You tell me what position you want to be on on this curve and I will build you an operation that gets this done. But here's another way of thinking about operations management, imagine you and I would do some benchmarking. We would go through the industry and for each of the call centers we collect information about their efficiency and their waiting times. Our own position is here, we start our benchmarking with call center A, call center A has a shorter response time than we do, which we understand when we look at their cost efficiency, which is worse than ours. Cool, these guys have made their cost quality trade off differently from what we did, and they hired a bunch of extra agents. Then we move to call center B, these folks have a longer wait time, a lower responsiveness, which gets them down here. Now they're not incompetent, instead, they have squeezed their cost and are running a more efficient operation. Good for them, third, we look at competitor C and this is where we get puzzled. This call center is providing a better service than we are and they are more efficient as well. Maybe they do not have as short of a response time as competitor A and are not as cheap as competitor B, but compared to us they are faster and more efficient. The academic term for this is that competitor C pareto dominates us. Now, to stay with academic terms for a moment, we define the line of all call centers, of all firms, of all operations that are not pareto dominated by somebody else as the efficiency frontier. Yes, there exists a tradeoff between cost and quality, but this is the elite set of firms that has nobody providing better service at lower cost. Sadly, our own call center is not on the efficient frontier. We can visualize our inefficiency as a distance between us and the frontier, this inefficiency has two consequences for us. First, the good news, we have reasons to believe that we can improve our quality while also cutting our cost. We can become a better operation and a better cost center, this will be a win win. Second, to move to the upper right, we have to overcome some or all of our inefficiencies, this will require us to do some work, we have to up our game. We have to get better in what we do. Okay, let's get back to our airline data, here are some data from the largest US carriers. I also sprinkled in data from some of the global carriers, please note that this is not a careful scientific study, it is just an illustrative example. How do you think about this graph? If you wanted to apply for a job, if you wanted to make an equity investment, if you were a management consultant, what goes through your head as you look at this graph? You see the efficiency frontier is a very useful tool to think about an industry. All right, that's it for now. In this video we move beyond just pleasing the customer. Yes, we would love to increase the willingness to pay, but we have to do this with also achieving reasonable fulfillment costs. And for that we have to get rid of the inefficiencies in our operation. In the next video we'll discuss such inefficiencies look like the purpose of this entire course then, is to fight these inefficiencies. As I said before, we want to make things better, which means higher willingness to pay at lower cost of fulfillment, see you soon.
