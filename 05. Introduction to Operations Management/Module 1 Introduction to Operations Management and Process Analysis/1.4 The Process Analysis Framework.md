## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块1 - 运营管理与流程分析

### 课程1.4 流程分析框架

聚焦于**流程分析框架（Process Analysis Framework）**，核心是通过定义流程要素、量化关键指标（流量率、库存、流程时间）及识别瓶颈，系统诊断和优化运营效率。

#### 1. 流程分析的核心要素

##### 1.1 流程定义与流程图（Process Flow Diagram）

- **流程组成**：  
  - **输入（Input）**：原材料、患者、订单等初始资源。  
  - **输出（Output）**：成品、服务完成的结果（如吉他、治愈患者）。  
  - **资源（Resource）**：执行增值活动的机器或人员（用方框表示）。  
  - **库存（Inventory）**：流程中等待处理的流单元（用三角形表示）。  
- **流单元（Flow Unit）**：流程分析的最小单位（如单件产品、单个患者、单笔订单）。  

##### 1.2 关键时间指标

- **处理时间（Processing Time）**：单个资源处理流单元所需时间（如医生问诊20分钟/患者）。  
- **容量（Capacity）**：资源单位时间内的处理能力（容量=1/处理时间）。多个同类资源时，总容量=资源数量/处理时间。  

##### 1.3 瓶颈（Bottleneck）  

- **定义**：流程中容量最低的资源，决定整体流程的最大产能。  
- **影响**：流程产能=瓶颈资源的容量（如工厂每小时产能由最慢工位决定）。  

#### 2. 三大核心指标及其关系

##### 2.1 流量率（Flow Rate / Throughput）

- **定义**：单位时间通过流程的流单元数量（如医院每日处理100名患者）。  
- **决定因素**：取流程产能（由瓶颈决定）与市场需求的最小值。  
  - **需求约束（Demand-Constrained）**：市场需求<流程产能（如工厂产能过剩）。  
  - **产能约束（Capacity-Constrained）**：市场需求>流程产能（如急诊科超负荷）。  

##### 2.2 利用率（Utilization）

- **公式**：利用率=流量率/容量（如医生利用率=实际接诊患者数/理论最大接诊数）。  
- **意义**：反映资源使用效率（利用率≤100%）。  

##### 2.3 库存（Inventory） 

- **定义**：流程中所有流单元的数量（如医院当前患者总数）。  
- **与会计库存的区别**：流程视角的库存包括所有在制品（如等待患者），而非仅财务记录的成品库存。  

##### 2.4 流程时间（Flow Time）  

- **定义**：流单元从进入流程到完成的总时间（包括等待和处理时间）。  
- **案例**：患者从挂号到出院的全程时间（90%可能为等待，10%为实际诊疗）。  

##### 2.5 三者的数学关系（Little's Law） 

- **公式**：库存=流量率×流程时间（I = R×T）。  
- **应用**：已知任意两项可推算第三项（如通过缩短流程时间降低库存）。  

#### 3. 关键结论与行业启示

##### 3.1 瓶颈决定全局效率 

- 优化非瓶颈资源无法提升整体产能，需优先解决瓶颈（如增加最慢工位的设备或人力）。  

##### 3.2 流程分析需「现地现物」（Genchi Genbutsu）  

- 脱离实地观察的流程改进易失效（如丰田生产系统强调现场观察问题）。  

##### 3.3 指标联动性

- 缩短流程时间（如减少等待）可降低库存并提升流量率，形成良性循环。  

##### 3.4 柔性设计对抗复杂性 

- 混合生产（如奔驰混线生产燃油车与电动车）提升灵活性，但可能增加流程时间。  

#### 4. 行动建议

- **绘制流程图**：识别流单元、资源、库存节点，标注处理时间与容量。  
- **计算瓶颈**：通过容量对比找到限制性资源，评估其对整体产能的影响。  
- **优化优先级**：  
  - **产能约束流程**：优先扩容瓶颈资源（如增加急诊科医生）。  
  - **需求约束流程**：优化营销或服务设计以提升需求（如缩短患者等待时间吸引更多就诊）。  
- **数据驱动决策**：定期追踪流量率、库存、流程时间，利用Little's Law验证改进效果。

#### 总结  
流程分析是运营管理的核心工具，通过量化指标与可视化流程图，企业可精准定位低效环节（如瓶颈、高库存）、优化资源配置，最终实现效率与客户价值的双重提升。

## 模块标题: Week 5: Introduction to Operations Management and Process Analysis

引言: 

At its core, operations management is about finding and then reducing inefficiencies. We will start by examining key concepts such as cost-quality trade-off, the efficiency frontier, and three system inhibitors. We will also explore process analysis, enabling you to identify and analyze the steps involved in a process and make changes to improve its outcomes. By the end of this module, you will have opportunities to practice these concepts by creating process flow diagrams and calculating the resource with the lowest capacity. Additionally, you'll be able to practice calculating capacity, flow rate, and utilization. You will be able to transfer these skills to initiate process analysis within your organization.

Learning Objectives:
- Examine the drivers of good quality and high willingness-to-pay
- Identify three system inhibitors
- Define the efficiency frontier of an industry
- Map an operation as a process flow
- Compute the utilization of a resource
- Compute flow rate (and understand the definitions of inventory, flow time and flow rate)
- Compute a capacity of an individual resource and find the bottleneck in a process

### 第二章: Process Analysis

#### 视频小节1: The Process Analysis Framework

字幕文本: 

Operations management is looking at the way people and machines work. Genchi genbutsu is a concept of the famous Toyota production system. Now, I don't speak Japanese, but it means go and see for yourself. The literal Japanese meaning, I have been told, is real location, real thing, but the message is the same. In order to understand the problem, you have to observe what is happening on site where the work takes place rather than sitting in an armchair or conference room. At the 30,000 foot levels, all companies more or less look the same. They create products or services and hopefully are able to sell them for more money than it costs them to create those products and services. But on the ground at the zero foot level, every operation is unique. Now, there's no point in taking an academic operations management course to learn about the uniqueness of one particular operation. I owe you tools and frameworks that are generalizable that you can apply to the many settings that you encounter in your career. And to be frank, I'm not sure I would be any good in teaching you a particular trade other than how to be a business school professor. So the perspective we will be taking in this course is a compromise between the 30,000 foot level view of strategy and the frontline perspective of a specific job. Maybe we should call it the 5000 foot level view. At this level, I want you to think about the process with which work gets done. Process analysis is a framework I want to use in this course to analyze and improve operations. Let me elaborate what I mean with this. Every operation can be thought of as a process. In a process, there are inputs and there are outputs. These are pictures from a guitar plant that PVA guitars shows on the Internet. And you can see here, there's wood flowing in and guitars flowing out. When you do the analysis of the process, you have to pick what I will call a flow unit. A flow unit is really the atomic unit of analysis that you track as it journeys through the process. It's a guitar in a guitar plant, it's a patient in a hospital. It's a car in an automotive plant. It might be a ton of oil or a ton of steel in a big refinery or steam mill. And as this flow units journeys from being an input into being an output, it will be in one of two states. It can either be with a resource. A resource is visualized as a box in what we define in a moment as a process flow diagram. A resource adds value, it helps the flow unit on its journey from being an input to being an output. Those might be machines or those might be people. Most of the time, however, the flow unit is just sitting around doing nothing. Now, you see this pile of guitars here and the symbol that we use to visualize this is a triangle, it's like a pile of stuff sitting around. Arrows, then captures the flow. And so really, a process flow diagram is a map. It's a map of how a flow unit journeys from input to output. Now, at every resource, the flow unit would have to take some time. It might take a doctor 20 minutes to do a primary care examination. It would take an assembly line work of 37 seconds to install a rear view mirror. It might take an underwriter in a bank 35 minutes to approve a loan. We call those numbers the processing times. Now, rather than looking at the processing time, I can look at one over the processing time, and I call this the capacity, 1 over 20 minutes. A 20th patient per minute in what a doctor can see in primary care. Capacity tells us how many units can a worker see per unit of time? Now, let's just assume that you're having one doctor or one machine. This generalizes to multiple, say, m resources, and here, simply the capacity of those doctors, those underwriters those machines, together as a resource pool is computed as m divided by the processing time. Now, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link. And so somewhere along the journey in this process, there will be one resource that has the lowest capacity. We will refer to this resource as the bottleneck. We'll not be able to get more flow through this process than the bottleneck has capacity. Again, the step with the lowest capacity is called the bottleneck. The lowest capacity is not just the capacity of that bottleneck resource, but it's really the capacity of the entire process. So we say the process capacity is the capacity of the bottleneck. With this as a foundation, we can now define the three most important measures in any process. They are flow rate, inventory, and flow time. So let me define them one by one. Flow rate is oftentimes referred to as throughput. I will use flow rate and interchangeably. Flow rate captures how many flow units will go through the process per unit of time. 100 patients per day go through the emergency room. 1000 cars per shift go through the autoplant. 50,000 tons of steel per month come out of the steel mill. These are throughputs or flow rates. I like the term flow rate because it reminds us that there's a flow going on. Now, the flow rate would depend on two things, the capacity of the process, which we just saw was determined by the bottleneck, or the demand rate. It's a smaller of those two. If you have a process that can make 100,000 cars per quarter and you only have demand for 70,000 cars per quarter, well, you're only selling and making 70,000 cars. So once you have the flow rate, you know how much flows through the process or flows through every resource. Next you can compute the utilization. Utilization is flow rate divided by capacity. How much am I producing? Flow rate, divided by what I could be producing if I ran out, that's capacity. Again, utilization applies to the level of the resource. You might say, station tenant utilization of 75% on my assembly line right now, or utilization can apply to the entire process. You oftentimes see people say in the Wall Street Journal that our plant has a utilization of 95%. Again, by definition, utilization can never exceed 100%. Depending on whether you're constrained by demand or you're constrained by capacity, we say the process is demand constraint or capacity constraint. If you are capacity constraint, you're held back by your bottleneck. If you're demand constraint, you're really limited by your marketing, the quality of your product, the demand rate, or your sales generation, capacity or demand constraint. What is the constraint in your business right now? Well, that's flow rate. The next measure is inventory. Inventory is the number of flow units in the system. Let me repeat this, inventory is the number of flow units in the system. I wanted to be precise on that because it's different from what inventory is called in the world of accounting. Let me give you an example. I work a lot with hospitals, and in hospitals, well, patients will be the flow unit. And so the number of flow units in the system is my inventory. The number of patients that are currently in the waiting rooms and in the exam rooms are my inventory. Now, you look from an accounting perspective and you look at the balance sheet of the hospital, and I promise you, you will not see patients as an inventory. That's not because I'm right and the accountants are wrong, it's just we have different understandings of inventory. So again, inventory is a number of flow units in the system. The third measure is flow time. This is a measure that I find students oftentimes get most confused with. Flow time captures how long will it take a flow unit to go from the beginning of the process to the end of the process? It includes all work that is done on the flow unit, but it also includes all the time the flow unit spends in inventory sitting around doing nothing. Again, think maybe last time that you went through a hospital process or you applied for a mortgage. Oftentimes, what you see there, most of the time the process takes on the flow unit, most of the flow time it really spends on waiting as opposed to actual work time. So, flow rate, inventory, and flow time,again, in my view, these are the most important measures in any process. Now, you notice that they don't directly appear on financial statements. But to state the obvious, flow rate times price is your revenue. Inventory has a huge impact on your working capital productivity. And flow time has to do with this inconvenience of time that we talked about in the introduction module in the form of delays. One more footnote or comment on this slide. Oftentimes people talk about flow time and user terms such as lead times and cycle times. I don't like these terms because they're used very differently across different industries. And we will see that lead times is actually very different from flow times, different from cycle time. So I haven't introduced these concepts, not yet. For now, let's just stick with flow time. Today we have covered a lot of definitions. We talked about flow units, resources, and process flow diagrams. We talked about inventory, flow rate, and flow time. And we talked about capacity, utilization and the concept of the bottleneck. Of those, if you ask me to pick my favorite, I picked the idea of the bottleneck. Every process is only as good as its bottleneck. It's somewhat resembled steam time trials in cycling, it doesn't matter in the total forms team trials. When the first rides over the finish line, the perform moments of the team depends on the weaker riders. So whenever you want to improve an operation that is capacity constrained, your first job is finding the bottleneck. In the next session, we'll do some specific calculations to practice these definitions. I'll see you then.
