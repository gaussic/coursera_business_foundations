### 核心概念与框架  
1. **流程分析的定义与目标**  
   • **核心理念**：通过“现地现物”（Genchi Genbutsu）观察实际工作场景，而非纸上谈兵，以识别流程中的低效环节。  
   • **核心目标**：将复杂操作分解为可分析、可改进的流程单元，并利用工具（如流程流图）量化关键指标，定位瓶颈。  

2. **流程的基本组成要素**  
   • **流程单元（Flow Unit）**：流程中追踪的最小单位（如医院中的患者、汽车厂的车辆、炼油厂的原油）。  
   • **资源（Resource）**：为流程单元增值的人或机器（如医生、装配线工人、贷款审核员）。  
   • **库存（Inventory）**：系统中处于等待或处理状态的流程单元数量（与会计“库存”概念不同，例如医院中的患者数）。  

3. **关键指标与计算**  
   • **处理时间（Processing Time）**：资源处理单个流程单元所需时间（如医生问诊20分钟/人）。  
   • **产能（Capacity）**：单个资源单位时间的最大处理量（产能=1/处理时间；多个资源时，总产能=资源数/处理时间）。  
   • **瓶颈（Bottleneck）**：流程中产能最低的环节，决定整体流程产能（如自行车队速度由最慢车手决定）。  

---

### 系统改进与工具  
4. **流程流图（Process Flow Diagram）**  
   • **可视化工具**：用方框（资源）、三角形（库存堆积）、箭头（流动方向）绘制流程路径，直观展示流程单元从输入到输出的路径。  
   • **应用场景**：识别瓶颈、优化资源配置（如吉他工厂的木材到成品流程）。  

5. **三大核心指标**  
   • **流程速率（Flow Rate / Throughput）**：单位时间通过流程的单元数（如急诊室100患者/天），由需求率与瓶颈产能的较小值决定。  
   • **利用率（Utilization）**：实际产能与最大产能的比值（利用率=流程速率/产能），反映资源使用效率（如工厂利用率95%）。  
   • **流程时间（Flow Time）**：流程单元从进入系统到完成的总时间（含等待与处理时间，如贷款审批耗时3天，其中2.5天为等待）。  

---

### 实践应用与案例  
6. **瓶颈管理策略**  
   • **案例（汽车制造）**：若喷漆环节为瓶颈（产能50辆/小时），其他环节产能更高（如组装80辆/小时），则整体产能由喷漆环节决定。  
   • **改进方向**：优先提升瓶颈产能（如增加喷漆工位、优化工艺），而非非瓶颈环节。  

7. **需求与产能的动态平衡**  
   • **需求约束（Demand-Constrained）**：流程速率由市场需求决定（如产能10万辆车/季度，需求仅7万辆）。  
   • **产能约束（Capacity-Constrained）**：流程速率受限于瓶颈（如急诊室满负荷运行仍无法满足患者需求）。  

---

### 关键结论  
1. **流程分析的核心是识别瓶颈**：瓶颈决定系统整体效率，优化瓶颈是提升产能的关键。  
2. **数据驱动决策**：通过量化处理时间、产能、利用率等指标，科学评估流程效率（如计算医生每小时接诊量）。  
3. **流程时间包含隐性浪费**：实际流程时间中等待占比较高（如患者80%时间在排队），需通过减少库存缩短流程时间。  
4. **资源灵活配置的重要性**：通过调整资源分配（如动态调度医生班次），平衡需求波动与产能限制。  
5. **跨部门协作价值**：流程速率直接影响收入（流程速率×单价），库存影响流动资金，需与财务、销售部门协同优化。  

**最终目标**：通过流程分析工具，将复杂操作转化为可量化、可改进的模块，实现**更高效（提升流程速率）、更经济（降低库存与流程时间）、更灵活（动态应对需求变化）**的运营体系。

## 模块标题: Week 5: Introduction to Operations Management and Process Analysis

引言: 

At its core, operations management is about finding and then reducing inefficiencies. We will start by examining key concepts such as cost-quality trade-off, the efficiency frontier, and three system inhibitors. We will also explore process analysis, enabling you to identify and analyze the steps involved in a process and make changes to improve its outcomes. By the end of this module, you will have opportunities to practice these concepts by creating process flow diagrams and calculating the resource with the lowest capacity. Additionally, you'll be able to practice calculating capacity, flow rate, and utilization. You will be able to transfer these skills to initiate process analysis within your organization.

Learning Objectives:
- Examine the drivers of good quality and high willingness-to-pay
- Identify three system inhibitors
- Define the efficiency frontier of an industry
- Map an operation as a process flow
- Compute the utilization of a resource
- Compute flow rate (and understand the definitions of inventory, flow time and flow rate)
- Compute a capacity of an individual resource and find the bottleneck in a process

字幕文本: 

Operations management is looking at the way people and machines work. Genchi genbutsu is a concept of the famous Toyota production system. Now, I don't speak Japanese, but it means go and see for yourself. The literal Japanese meaning, I have been told, is real location, real thing, but the message is the same. In order to understand the problem, you have to observe what is happening on site where the work takes place rather than sitting in an armchair or conference room. At the 30,000 foot levels, all companies more or less look the same. They create products or services and hopefully are able to sell them for more money than it costs them to create those products and services. But on the ground at the zero foot level, every operation is unique. Now, there's no point in taking an academic operations management course to learn about the uniqueness of one particular operation. I owe you tools and frameworks that are generalizable that you can apply to the many settings that you encounter in your career. And to be frank, I'm not sure I would be any good in teaching you a particular trade other than how to be a business school professor. So the perspective we will be taking in this course is a compromise between the 30,000 foot level view of strategy and the frontline perspective of a specific job. Maybe we should call it the 5000 foot level view. At this level, I want you to think about the process with which work gets done. Process analysis is a framework I want to use in this course to analyze and improve operations. Let me elaborate what I mean with this. Every operation can be thought of as a process. In a process, there are inputs and there are outputs. These are pictures from a guitar plant that PVA guitars shows on the Internet. And you can see here, there's wood flowing in and guitars flowing out. When you do the analysis of the process, you have to pick what I will call a flow unit. A flow unit is really the atomic unit of analysis that you track as it journeys through the process. It's a guitar in a guitar plant, it's a patient in a hospital. It's a car in an automotive plant. It might be a ton of oil or a ton of steel in a big refinery or steam mill. And as this flow units journeys from being an input into being an output, it will be in one of two states. It can either be with a resource. A resource is visualized as a box in what we define in a moment as a process flow diagram. A resource adds value, it helps the flow unit on its journey from being an input to being an output. Those might be machines or those might be people. Most of the time, however, the flow unit is just sitting around doing nothing. Now, you see this pile of guitars here and the symbol that we use to visualize this is a triangle, it's like a pile of stuff sitting around. Arrows, then captures the flow. And so really, a process flow diagram is a map. It's a map of how a flow unit journeys from input to output. Now, at every resource, the flow unit would have to take some time. It might take a doctor 20 minutes to do a primary care examination. It would take an assembly line work of 37 seconds to install a rear view mirror. It might take an underwriter in a bank 35 minutes to approve a loan. We call those numbers the processing times. Now, rather than looking at the processing time, I can look at one over the processing time, and I call this the capacity, 1 over 20 minutes. A 20th patient per minute in what a doctor can see in primary care. Capacity tells us how many units can a worker see per unit of time? Now, let's just assume that you're having one doctor or one machine. This generalizes to multiple, say, m resources, and here, simply the capacity of those doctors, those underwriters those machines, together as a resource pool is computed as m divided by the processing time. Now, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link. And so somewhere along the journey in this process, there will be one resource that has the lowest capacity. We will refer to this resource as the bottleneck. We'll not be able to get more flow through this process than the bottleneck has capacity. Again, the step with the lowest capacity is called the bottleneck. The lowest capacity is not just the capacity of that bottleneck resource, but it's really the capacity of the entire process. So we say the process capacity is the capacity of the bottleneck. With this as a foundation, we can now define the three most important measures in any process. They are flow rate, inventory, and flow time. So let me define them one by one. Flow rate is oftentimes referred to as throughput. I will use flow rate and interchangeably. Flow rate captures how many flow units will go through the process per unit of time. 100 patients per day go through the emergency room. 1000 cars per shift go through the autoplant. 50,000 tons of steel per month come out of the steel mill. These are throughputs or flow rates. I like the term flow rate because it reminds us that there's a flow going on. Now, the flow rate would depend on two things, the capacity of the process, which we just saw was determined by the bottleneck, or the demand rate. It's a smaller of those two. If you have a process that can make 100,000 cars per quarter and you only have demand for 70,000 cars per quarter, well, you're only selling and making 70,000 cars. So once you have the flow rate, you know how much flows through the process or flows through every resource. Next you can compute the utilization. Utilization is flow rate divided by capacity. How much am I producing? Flow rate, divided by what I could be producing if I ran out, that's capacity. Again, utilization applies to the level of the resource. You might say, station tenant utilization of 75% on my assembly line right now, or utilization can apply to the entire process. You oftentimes see people say in the Wall Street Journal that our plant has a utilization of 95%. Again, by definition, utilization can never exceed 100%. Depending on whether you're constrained by demand or you're constrained by capacity, we say the process is demand constraint or capacity constraint. If you are capacity constraint, you're held back by your bottleneck. If you're demand constraint, you're really limited by your marketing, the quality of your product, the demand rate, or your sales generation, capacity or demand constraint. What is the constraint in your business right now? Well, that's flow rate. The next measure is inventory. Inventory is the number of flow units in the system. Let me repeat this, inventory is the number of flow units in the system. I wanted to be precise on that because it's different from what inventory is called in the world of accounting. Let me give you an example. I work a lot with hospitals, and in hospitals, well, patients will be the flow unit. And so the number of flow units in the system is my inventory. The number of patients that are currently in the waiting rooms and in the exam rooms are my inventory. Now, you look from an accounting perspective and you look at the balance sheet of the hospital, and I promise you, you will not see patients as an inventory. That's not because I'm right and the accountants are wrong, it's just we have different understandings of inventory. So again, inventory is a number of flow units in the system. The third measure is flow time. This is a measure that I find students oftentimes get most confused with. Flow time captures how long will it take a flow unit to go from the beginning of the process to the end of the process? It includes all work that is done on the flow unit, but it also includes all the time the flow unit spends in inventory sitting around doing nothing. Again, think maybe last time that you went through a hospital process or you applied for a mortgage. Oftentimes, what you see there, most of the time the process takes on the flow unit, most of the flow time it really spends on waiting as opposed to actual work time. So, flow rate, inventory, and flow time,again, in my view, these are the most important measures in any process. Now, you notice that they don't directly appear on financial statements. But to state the obvious, flow rate times price is your revenue. Inventory has a huge impact on your working capital productivity. And flow time has to do with this inconvenience of time that we talked about in the introduction module in the form of delays. One more footnote or comment on this slide. Oftentimes people talk about flow time and user terms such as lead times and cycle times. I don't like these terms because they're used very differently across different industries. And we will see that lead times is actually very different from flow times, different from cycle time. So I haven't introduced these concepts, not yet. For now, let's just stick with flow time. Today we have covered a lot of definitions. We talked about flow units, resources, and process flow diagrams. We talked about inventory, flow rate, and flow time. And we talked about capacity, utilization and the concept of the bottleneck. Of those, if you ask me to pick my favorite, I picked the idea of the bottleneck. Every process is only as good as its bottleneck. It's somewhat resembled steam time trials in cycling, it doesn't matter in the total forms team trials. When the first rides over the finish line, the perform moments of the team depends on the weaker riders. So whenever you want to improve an operation that is capacity constrained, your first job is finding the bottleneck. In the next session, we'll do some specific calculations to practice these definitions. I'll see you then.
