### 课程2.7 七大浪费

系统解析了精益运营中的**七大浪费**及其识别方法，结合制造业与医疗行业案例，揭示了浪费的本质与改进策略，并引入 **OEE（整体设备效率）** 作为量化工具。

#### 1. 七大浪费的定义与分类

根据丰田生产系统（TPS）和大野耐一的框架，浪费分为以下类型：  
1. **动作浪费（Motion Waste）**：员工不必要的移动（如工具摆放不合理导致频繁转身取物）；  
2. **缺陷浪费（Defects Waste）**：返工或报废品（如医疗中的重复检查或误诊）；  
3. **过度加工（Overprocessing Waste）**：超出客户需求的工艺（如给仅需普通包装的产品使用高端包装）；  
4. **等待浪费（Waiting Waste）**：资源闲置（如ICU病床因清洁流程低效导致空置）；  
5. **库存浪费（Inventory Waste）**：过量原材料或半成品积压（如生产线前堆积的未加工部件）；  
6. **过量生产（Overproduction Waste）**：提前或超需求生产（如医院过度安排非必要检查）；  
7. **运输浪费（Transportation Waste）**：不必要的物料搬运（如工厂内多次中转零件）。
  
**第八种浪费**：**智力浪费**（未充分利用员工创意与经验）。

#### 2. 识别浪费的工具与方法

- **OEE（整体设备效率）**：通过三个维度量化资源浪费：  
  - **可用率**（停机时间损失）：如医疗设备因维护计划不合理导致20%时间闲置；  
  - **性能率**（速度损失）：如生产线因设备老化导致产能仅达理论值的80%；  
  - **合格率**（质量损失）：如制造业因工艺缺陷导致5%产品返工。  
- **TIM WOOD记忆法**：将七大浪费首字母组合为「Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overprocessing, Overproduction, Defects」，便于快速记忆。  
- **数字化监控**：利用AI和机器视觉技术实时追踪流程（如视频分析生产线动作效率）。

#### 3. 行业应用与案例分析

- **医疗行业**：  
  - **缺陷浪费**：患者重复检查（如因信息未共享导致同一化验多次进行）；  
  - **运输浪费**：患者频繁转科（如急诊科与影像科距离过远增加转运时间）；  
  - **OEE优化**：通过实时数据监控ICU病床利用率，将空置率从18%降至5%。  
- **制造业**：  
  - **动作浪费**：工人因工具摆放混乱导致单件生产时间增加30%；  
  - **过量生产**：因需求预测偏差导致库存积压，占用50%仓储空间。

#### 4. 消除浪费的策略

- **流程优化**：  
  - **价值流映射（VSM）**：绘制端到端流程，识别非增值环节（如减少医院患者登记与检查间的等待环节）；  
-  **单件流（One-Piece Flow）**：小批量生产减少库存（如将汽车零部件批量从1000件降至50件）。  
- **技术赋能**：  
  - **IoT与预测性维护**：通过传感器预警设备故障，减少停机时间（如航空发动机维护周期优化）；  
  - **AI驱动的视觉检测**：实时监控生产线动作标准化程度（如识别工人多余动作并反馈改进）。  
- **文化变革**：  
  - **全员参与（Kaizen）**：鼓励员工提案改善（如护士建议优化药品配送路径）；  
  - **精益培训**：通过模拟案例培养员工浪费敏感度（如使用沙盘演练库存管理）。

#### 关键结论与行动指南

1. **数据驱动决策**：OEE的三大维度（可用率、性能率、合格率）需结合实时数据分析（如医疗设备每日利用率报表）；  
2. **跨行业普适性**：七大浪费框架可迁移至服务业（如物流中的运输浪费）和知识工作（如软件开发中的过度设计）；  
3. **技术伦理平衡**：数字化监控需兼顾效率与隐私（如匿名化处理生产线视频数据）；  
4. **持续改进机制**：建立PDCA循环（如每月复盘OEE指标，制定下一阶段优化目标）。

通过上述方法，企业可系统性减少浪费，提升资源利用率，实现精益运营的终极目标——**以最小投入创造最大客户价值**。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

#### 视频小节3: The Seven Sources of Waste

字幕文本: 

The OE framework has helped us to look at a resource and separate waste from value add time. In this session, let's talk a bit more about what waste looks like. According to Eltaciono, there exists seven sources of waste. Already introduced the key idea in the last session moving is not working. So as we look for waste, it is not just the or resource that provides the opportunity, busyness per se is not a virtue. A piece of equipment might be highly utilized, or an employee might always be overworked, but that is no guarantee that the process of the employee is adding value. Let's start by going back to the Taylor quote. Remember we talked about awkward, inefficient or ill directed movements of man? Well, your awkward, inefficient and ill directed operations professor will now define seven sources of waste. The first waste I want to define is wasted motion. It's unnecessary movement of people during their work. I just changed the tire of my bike this morning. It took me probably twice as long as it takes the skilled bike mechanic down the street from here. And so that is a form of wasted motion. The same is really true for a chef. I love watching chefs in the kitchen. Every motion adds value. There's no fumbling, there's no pausing. It's just perfection. That's just not me. The second waste relates to defects. Defects are obviously not adding value. They're really annoying for the customer if they remain undetected. And if you detect the defect within the boundaries of your process, they require you fixing them, something that is known as rework. So defects are a second source of waste. Over-processing is a third source of waste, which relates to producing a higher quality than what is needed or demanded by the customer. It's like serving a fancy meal to your relative who only eats cheeseburgers. Or maybe with my German family only loves Bardos. So now we are up to three motion, overprocessing and defects. All of those three can be found by looking at one resource in isolation. To see the other four sources of waste, we really have to move beyond one worker performing one task and look at the process and many workers in a line. Just think back to the subway case. The three persons making a sandwich every 46 seconds. As you switch to looking at the process now, we typically encounter idle time. Some resources by definition, have more capacity than the bottleneck, and so they will incur idle time. Now, owner referred to idle time as waiting, as the workers really waiting for the flow unit the part. Personally, I like idle time better because I don't want to confuse it with customers waiting for a resource. But again, owner calls it waiting and who am I to criticize the guard of operations? Next, there's inventory. If the flow is not well coordinated, some of the resources will produce faster than the others. In particular, it's going to be the bottleneck was going to be the slowest step, and we're going to end up with inventory in the process and typically in front of the bottleneck. That is our fifth source of waste. Inventory also happens when we produce more than what is demanded by the customer. We go back to our discussion of TAC time and its role of keeping us in sync with demand. Ono named this overproduction and he made it the 6th source of waste. And finally, as we have multiple resources in the process, we have to move the flow unit from one resource to the other, which is known as transportation. So here they are, seven sources of waste. Again, more to come in future videos, but I wanted to introduce a framework. First, let me make two observations. First, how do you remember these seven sources of waste? There are really multiple memory tricks out there, but the one I like the best is Tim Wood. Tim Wood simply combines transport, inventory, motion, waiting, overprocessing, overproduction and defects. I know it's somewhat stupid, but at least for me, it has always worked. And then second, the operations community now increasingly refers to an 8th source of waste, and that's a waste of intellect, which means not using the ideas of those working in the process. That is a wasted opportunity and thus an 8th source of waste. We talk more about involving the workers in future discussions on quality, at this point, think back to the comment I made on Tailorism at the beginning of this module. In the 20 years that I've been doing consulting work and research collaborations with companies, I've always been amazed how universally applicable the seven sources of waste end up being. Yes, waste really might look different in each industry. Yes, this framework has its root in manufacturing, but also works well in other settings, including healthcare. I show you some examples here on this slide. I find it almost shocking how directly the seven sources of waste apply to healthcare and similar settings. Rework in healthcare is called readmissions. Hospitals have a whole department called Patient Transports. Rooms, equipment and providers are at times idle, as we discussed at the beginning of the module. And don't get me started on overproduction the provision of unnecessary procedures by the providers. Anyway, I'm sure you have seen these things in one form or the other in your own experience. Now, spotting waste really requires careful observation. In the past, this has mostly been done by stopwatching people. For example, I've done some work myself using a method called time and motion studies. What I did is I video recorded primary care providers and then I would dissect the encounters that they had with their patients. Second by second, with the help of some medical experts and other doctors to look for ways, this would give us a sense on how doctors are spending their time with patients. It was fascinating to me to see how little time was spent on actual examinations. Such data collection is obviously very tedious. However, when you show up with either a video camera or a stopwatch to collect data, chances are that you're not really getting representative data from the operations. Let me make two observations on how such time and motion studies are changing as we're moving along in history. First, most service operations these days are really digitized, and so oftentimes you can get timestamp data from the operations, particularly, call centers, claim processing, customer support, or reading X rays. And all these processes are something that I refer to as digital exhaust. Such processes store when an employee touches a record and how long they work on it. That allows you to compute the processing times even years after the work has happened. Taylor's claim of movement leaving nothing tangible behind is simply no longer true in our modern digital world. Second, we now really have technology to use image processing and AI to do this observation for us. To help illustrate, I've been working with a startup run by two Pen grads. And these guys have developed machine vision technology that helps manufacturing firms to measure processing times, spot waste, and detect quality problems via video cameras that are installed at the assembly line. What you see here is the assembly line of Pride Mobility. Pride is making high end wheelchair a business also run by a Wharton grad. And the video footage here on this slide shows you line segment 170, which consists out of some manual assembly operation. And you notice that the image recognition of the software is tracking the flow unit, which is the wheelchair, and it's also tracking the resource, which is the gentleman here in the white T shirt. And then the software is smart enough to spot when the worker is idle or the worker is spending more time on the flow unit as usual. All this data is then fed into a reporting system that spits out report that look like this. Now, I'm sure you've seen this in your own life. This is really more and more 1984, George Orwell than is emerging in our society. But it doesn't matter if you drive a modern car, surf the Internet, or go for a walk with your phone. Everything that we now do can be tracked and leaves a data trail behind. This is certainly worthy a longer discussion about privacy and individual freedoms. If you're interested in this topic, I make sure to provide a link to some work I've been doing in this space. I do, however, think that these various tracking technologies will and should play an increasing role in operations management. In the previous video, we defined the OEE as a percentage of time that the resource is doing what it is designed to do. Until now, waste was an abstract enemy that was somehow reducing our OEE. The Seven Sources of Waste Framework helps us to see how exactly we waste capacity tim Wood, in other words, is the main enemy to a lean operations. In the next video, I want to switch the perspective and talk about the view of the flow unit, be it a customer in a service process or Widget in a production process. See you then.
