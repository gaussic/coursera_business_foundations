### 核心概念与理论框架  
1. **七种浪费来源（TIM WOOD框架）**  
   • **Transportation（运输）**：流程单元（如患者、物料）在流程中的无效移动（如医院患者多次转运）。  
   • **Inventory（库存）**：过量库存占用空间与资金（如ICU病床前的等待患者队列）。  
   • **Motion（多余动作）**：员工执行非增值动作（如医生寻找工具、新手更换自行车轮胎的低效操作）。  
   • **Waiting（等待）**：资源或流程单元的空闲时间（如MRI设备闲置、飞机滑行）。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

#### 视频小节3: The Seven Sources of Waste

字幕文本: 

The OE framework has helped us to look at a resource and separate waste from value add time. In this session, let's talk a bit more about what waste looks like. According to Eltaciono, there exists seven sources of waste. Already introduced the key idea in the last session moving is not working. So as we look for waste, it is not just the or resource that provides the opportunity, busyness per se is not a virtue. A piece of equipment might be highly utilized, or an employee might always be overworked, but that is no guarantee that the process of the employee is adding value. Let's start by going back to the Taylor quote. Remember we talked about awkward, inefficient or ill directed movements of man? Well, your awkward, inefficient and ill directed operations professor will now define seven sources of waste. The first waste I want to define is wasted motion. It's unnecessary movement of people during their work. I just changed the tire of my bike this morning. It took me probably twice as long as it takes the skilled bike mechanic down the street from here. And so that is a form of wasted motion. The same is really true for a chef. I love watching chefs in the kitchen. Every motion adds value. There's no fumbling, there's no pausing. It's just perfection. That's just not me. The second waste relates to defects. Defects are obviously not adding value. They're really annoying for the customer if they remain undetected. And if you detect the defect within the boundaries of your process, they require you fixing them, something that is known as rework. So defects are a second source of waste. Over-processing is a third source of waste, which relates to producing a higher quality than what is needed or demanded by the customer. It's like serving a fancy meal to your relative who only eats cheeseburgers. Or maybe with my German family only loves Bardos. So now we are up to three motion, overprocessing and defects. All of those three can be found by looking at one resource in isolation. To see the other four sources of waste, we really have to move beyond one worker performing one task and look at the process and many workers in a line. Just think back to the subway case. The three persons making a sandwich every 46 seconds. As you switch to looking at the process now, we typically encounter idle time. Some resources by definition, have more capacity than the bottleneck, and so they will incur idle time. Now, owner referred to idle time as waiting, as the workers really waiting for the flow unit the part. Personally, I like idle time better because I don't want to confuse it with customers waiting for a resource. But again, owner calls it waiting and who am I to criticize the guard of operations? Next, there's inventory. If the flow is not well coordinated, some of the resources will produce faster than the others. In particular, it's going to be the bottleneck was going to be the slowest step, and we're going to end up with inventory in the process and typically in front of the bottleneck. That is our fifth source of waste. Inventory also happens when we produce more than what is demanded by the customer. We go back to our discussion of TAC time and its role of keeping us in sync with demand. Ono named this overproduction and he made it the 6th source of waste. And finally, as we have multiple resources in the process, we have to move the flow unit from one resource to the other, which is known as transportation. So here they are, seven sources of waste. Again, more to come in future videos, but I wanted to introduce a framework. First, let me make two observations. First, how do you remember these seven sources of waste? There are really multiple memory tricks out there, but the one I like the best is Tim Wood. Tim Wood simply combines transport, inventory, motion, waiting, overprocessing, overproduction and defects. I know it's somewhat stupid, but at least for me, it has always worked. And then second, the operations community now increasingly refers to an 8th source of waste, and that's a waste of intellect, which means not using the ideas of those working in the process. That is a wasted opportunity and thus an 8th source of waste. We talk more about involving the workers in future discussions on quality, at this point, think back to the comment I made on Tailorism at the beginning of this module. In the 20 years that I've been doing consulting work and research collaborations with companies, I've always been amazed how universally applicable the seven sources of waste end up being. Yes, waste really might look different in each industry. Yes, this framework has its root in manufacturing, but also works well in other settings, including healthcare. I show you some examples here on this slide. I find it almost shocking how directly the seven sources of waste apply to healthcare and similar settings. Rework in healthcare is called readmissions. Hospitals have a whole department called Patient Transports. Rooms, equipment and providers are at times idle, as we discussed at the beginning of the module. And don't get me started on overproduction the provision of unnecessary procedures by the providers. Anyway, I'm sure you have seen these things in one form or the other in your own experience. Now, spotting waste really requires careful observation. In the past, this has mostly been done by stopwatching people. For example, I've done some work myself using a method called time and motion studies. What I did is I video recorded primary care providers and then I would dissect the encounters that they had with their patients. Second by second, with the help of some medical experts and other doctors to look for ways, this would give us a sense on how doctors are spending their time with patients. It was fascinating to me to see how little time was spent on actual examinations. Such data collection is obviously very tedious. However, when you show up with either a video camera or a stopwatch to collect data, chances are that you're not really getting representative data from the operations. Let me make two observations on how such time and motion studies are changing as we're moving along in history. First, most service operations these days are really digitized, and so oftentimes you can get timestamp data from the operations, particularly, call centers, claim processing, customer support, or reading X rays. And all these processes are something that I refer to as digital exhaust. Such processes store when an employee touches a record and how long they work on it. That allows you to compute the processing times even years after the work has happened. Taylor's claim of movement leaving nothing tangible behind is simply no longer true in our modern digital world. Second, we now really have technology to use image processing and AI to do this observation for us. To help illustrate, I've been working with a startup run by two Pen grads. And these guys have developed machine vision technology that helps manufacturing firms to measure processing times, spot waste, and detect quality problems via video cameras that are installed at the assembly line. What you see here is the assembly line of Pride Mobility. Pride is making high end wheelchair a business also run by a Wharton grad. And the video footage here on this slide shows you line segment 170, which consists out of some manual assembly operation. And you notice that the image recognition of the software is tracking the flow unit, which is the wheelchair, and it's also tracking the resource, which is the gentleman here in the white T shirt. And then the software is smart enough to spot when the worker is idle or the worker is spending more time on the flow unit as usual. All this data is then fed into a reporting system that spits out report that look like this. Now, I'm sure you've seen this in your own life. This is really more and more 1984, George Orwell than is emerging in our society. But it doesn't matter if you drive a modern car, surf the Internet, or go for a walk with your phone. Everything that we now do can be tracked and leaves a data trail behind. This is certainly worthy a longer discussion about privacy and individual freedoms. If you're interested in this topic, I make sure to provide a link to some work I've been doing in this space. I do, however, think that these various tracking technologies will and should play an increasing role in operations management. In the previous video, we defined the OEE as a percentage of time that the resource is doing what it is designed to do. Until now, waste was an abstract enemy that was somehow reducing our OEE. The Seven Sources of Waste Framework helps us to see how exactly we waste capacity tim Wood, in other words, is the main enemy to a lean operations. In the next video, I want to switch the perspective and talk about the view of the flow unit, be it a customer in a service process or Widget in a production process. See you then.
