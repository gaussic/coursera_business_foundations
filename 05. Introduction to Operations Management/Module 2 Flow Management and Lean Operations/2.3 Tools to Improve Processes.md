### 核心概念与工具  
1. **瓶颈转移（Offloading the Bottleneck）**  
   • **定义**：通过减少瓶颈环节的工作量或转移其任务来提升整体流程效率。  
   • **实施方式**：  
     ◦ **任务重新分配**：将瓶颈环节的部分任务转移至非瓶颈资源（如Subway将员工2的包装任务外包）。  
     ◦ **自动化**：使用技术减少瓶颈处理时间（如麦当劳的酱料自动分配器）。  
   • **案例（《目标》中的童子军徒步）**：通过分担“Herbie”的背包重量（瓶颈），提升整体队伍行进速度。  

2. **生产线平衡与节拍时间（Takt Time）**  
   • **节拍时间（Takt Time）**：为满足需求所需的生产节奏。  
     ◦ **公式**：`节拍时间 = 可用时间 / 需求率`  
     ◦ **案例（Subway需求160三明治/小时）**：  
       \[
       \text{节拍时间} = \frac{3600\秒}{160} = 22.5\秒/\text{单位}
       \]  
   • **目标人力计算**：  
     ◦ **公式**：`目标人力 = 总劳动力内容 / 节拍时间`  
     ◦ **案例**：劳动力内容120秒/单位 → 目标人力=120/22.5≈5.33人（需向上取整为6人）。  

3. **专业化（Specialization）的利弊**  
   • **优势**：  
     ◦ **减少切换时间**：员工专注单一任务（如仅操作收银机）避免切换工具或流程。  
     ◦ **学习效应**：重复操作提升熟练度（如每日切1000个西红柿）。  
     ◦ **降低技能要求**：简化培训与工资成本（如汽车装配线分工）。  
     ◦ **设备成本优化**：避免重复设备（如多个收银机）。  
   • **劣势**：  
     ◦ **空闲时间增加**：分工细化导致非瓶颈资源闲置（如Subway案例中7名员工总空闲时间达27秒/单位）。  
     ◦ **依赖性与风险**：单一技能员工缺勤可能导致生产线停滞（如全球供应链中的关键部件依赖）。

### 案例分析（Subway餐厅优化）  
4. **需求激增时的流程改进**  
   • **原始瓶颈**：员工2处理时间46秒/单位，产能78单位/小时。  
   • **需求提升至160单位/小时**：  
     ◦ **节拍时间目标**：22.5秒/单位，需至少6名员工。  
     ◦ **实际挑战**：任务不可分割性（如收银需20秒）导致需7名员工，总空闲时间27秒/单位。  

5. **专业化的成本与效益**  
   • **流程平衡与空闲时间**：  
     ◦ 3名员工时总空闲时间18秒/单位，利用率86.9%；  
     ◦ 7名员工时总空闲时间27秒/单位，但产能提升至160单位/小时。  
   • **权衡**：产能提升带来的收入增长（如每小时多售82单位）需覆盖增加的劳动力成本。  

---

### 关键结论  
1. **瓶颈优先原则**：  
   • 任何流程改进需从瓶颈入手，微小优化（如减少3秒处理时间）可能显著提升利润（Subway案例利润增长53.6%）。  

2. **节拍时间驱动资源配置**：  
   • 节拍时间将市场需求转化为明确的产能目标，指导人力与设备规划（如Subway需求160单位需6-7人）。  

3. **专业化的动态平衡**：  
   • **效率与灵活性权衡**：专业化提升短期效率，但牺牲系统鲁棒性（如员工缺勤风险）和增加协调成本。  
   • **全局优化**：需结合自动化（减少瓶颈）、任务再分配（平衡产线）与供应链协同（降低依赖）。  

4. **精益工具的综合应用**：  
   • **OEE（设备综合效率）**：量化设备利用率、性能与质量损失。  
   • **%-VAT（价值增值时间占比）**：识别流程单元在系统中的非增值时间（如等待）。  

**最终目标**：通过**瓶颈优化**、**节拍驱动平衡**与**战略性专业化**，构建**高响应（需求匹配）、低成本（减少浪费）、高韧性（风险可控）**的精益运营体系。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

#### 视频小节3: Tools to Improve Processes

字幕文本: 

The reason why we analyze processes, the reason why we compute things such as idle time and labor utilization levels or the cost of direct labor, is of course to improve the process. We want to make things better. In today's video, I will introduce three tools will help you improve your process. I will refer to them as offloading the bottleneck, balancing the line using tech time, and we'll talk about specialization. Let's start with the idea of offloading the bottleneck. In 1984, Ellie Goldratt, wrote a highly successful book entitled The Goal. Hard to believe, that the book is about operations management as in operations management textbook written as a novel. Unlike my books, it has sold millions of copies. The hero of the book is a fictitious plant manager by the name of Alex, who discovers the principles of process analysis. Alex has this epiphany when he takes a group of boy scouts for hike in the forest. The group takes a single file path and search as close to each other. But the longer they march, the more the group spreads out. The boys in the front tend to be the fast ones as they work at their own rate leaving the others behind. One chubby scout by the name of Herbie is holding the group back. He has hundreds of meters of empty trail in front of him, and a group of impatient boy scouts, that due to the narrowness of the trail cannot overtake him, behind him. Alex realizes that this hike has a lot in common with this production process. He associates the speed with which the entire group is moving with the flow rate in the plant. Just as a plant cannot produce faster than the bottleneck, the group of boy scouts cannot walk faster than Herbie. Any process improvement starts by looking at the bottleneck. In the case of Herbie, Alex soon found out that this ability to walk as fast as the other kids was not just constrained by his pure physiological limitations, but also by Herbie carrying a rather large and heavy backpack with plenty of snacks inside. To improve the hiking speed of the group, Alex then takes Herbie's backpack and puts the content up among the other faster scouts. Yes, those scouts are now slowed down a bit, but Herbie is able to walk faster, and that is all that counts. In general, we refer to the improvement strategy of moving work away from the bottleneck as offloading the bottleneck. Offloading the bottleneck can take multiple forms. First we can think about reassigning activities to other resources with more capacity, an improvement strategy that we will refer to in a moment as line balancing. Second, we can think about automating some of the activities, consuming time at the bottleneck by using technology. For example, we might be able to automate the dispensing of a wrapping paper, which has a potential of reducing the processing time for employee number 2. As a side note, McDonald's key innovations on their way to becoming the fast food empire, was the invention of a condiment dispenser, which will provide an exact supply of ketchup or mayonnaise by the pressing of a button. We can think about outsourcing, some of the activities consuming time at the bottleneck. Imagine if it would be possible to put the condiments in the back at the beginning of the ship, or to even purchase bags that are already loaded with condiments. This would reduce a time for employee 2 which, given that employee 2 is a bottleneck, would increase the capacity of the process. Next, let's turn to line balancing and tack time. In our prior calculations, we found the capacity of the three-person line to be about 78 sandwiches per hour. What are you doing when demand is higher? The busy stores at lunchtime have demands all the way up to 160 sandwiches an hour. For that, well, we clearly need more labor. I want you to wrestle with two questions while you put me on pause. The first one is about the cycle time. What cycle time do you need to hit to serve 160 customers per hour? The second one is on staffing, how many workers will you need? Put me on pause now. Here we go again. Let's get this done together. What cycle time do you need to meet the demand of 160 sandwiches per hour? Well, there are 3,600 seconds in an hour, and I want to make myself 160 sandwiches during this hour. The hours cancels out, and I'm going to get 22.5 seconds per sandwich. That is the cycle time I need to achieve to meet demand. In a moment, we're going to refer to this number as the tact time. That's going to be the tact of demand. Tact really tells us how fast we have to run, and then what cadence we have to operate to be in sync with demand. That's the whole idea of tact. Tact also helps us find out how many people we need to hire at the very minimum. That number is not going to be an exact number, but it gives us a lower bound. The logic behind this is as follows. We're going to look here at 120 seconds of labor that I know are in a sandwich. That is our labor conduct, 120 seconds per unit. We're going to divide it by the tact time, the 22.5 seconds per unit. We have seconds per unit in the nominator, and also seconds per unit in the denominator, so that cancels out. We're going to get a staffing level of a minimum of 5.33. If we round this up to the next integer, I see that at the minimum, I need six workers. It's not going to go exact, but it's the target. We're going to see in the next slide, that actually we'll need a little bit more labor than that. This number really provides a first good shot. Let me formalize this. We formally now define tact time as the ratio between the available time and the demand rate. Available time was in our example 3,600 seconds per hour. We want to have 160 units per hour of demand, so the takt is 22.5 seconds per unit. The word takt comes from the German word takt, which is used in the musical world. We want to make sure that not every musician is playing at his or her own pace, but everybody stays in sync. I think it's very appropriate to use the word takt in the case of process analysis. Let me emphasize. A takt time is an ambition, it is a target. It does not depend on the capacity or the capability of the process, it's just churning demand into a target cycle time for the process. Once we have done the takt time, we can compute the target manpower. The target manpower is resource a ratio between the labor content and the takt time. In our case, it was 5.3 feet person, which was 120 seconds of labor content, divided by 22.5 seconds of the takt per unit. Ideally, we would like to hire 5.33 persons. Since you cannot hire a third of a worker, this is clearly not feasible, and we were rounding this up to six. As we will see in a moment, even six might not be enough. The reason for that is at work cannot easily be divided into smaller chunks. For example, the cash register operation here, that takes 20 seconds. That is a block or a chunk that we cannot move easily forth and back. As you'll notice when you're allocating the activities across the resources here, the employees, even the bottleneck has some slack, has some idle time relative to the takt time. Again, line balancing means that you take the takt time 22.5 seconds in our example, and then you spread out the activities from grading the customer all the way to the cash register, subject to the constraint that no individual should have more work and their processing time than the takt time. If you notice you're going above the takt time, well, then you just move the work to the next resource and continue until you found out that in this case would actually need seven employees. Now let me point out some subtlety that I find somewhat counter-intuitive. It's counter-intuitive at least for me, I'm not sure about you. Here because of the demand rate, we said that even the bottleneck would have some idle time. Let's ignore that. Let's make us capacity constraint and assume that we're running at the rate of the bottleneck, which is producing a unit every 21 seconds. We can then compute how much idle time each of the workers has. It's going to be five seconds for the first worker, zero for the second worker, two seconds here for the next one, seven seconds, five seconds, seven seconds, and one second. Now, how much idle time do we now have? We have 5+0+2+7+5+7+1. We have 27 seconds per unit of idle time. Do you remember how much idle time we had with three workers? It was 18. Well, less than the 27. As we specialize, that idle time is going to go up. The more workers take on the work, the harder will it be to find a perfect balance. As I said, I find this counter-intuitive. Today, we talked about improvement strategies. We talked about offloading the bottleneck, and we talked about balancing the line using the concept of takt time. We have not yet talked about specialization. Here we go. Adam Smith a famous philosopher and economist wrote about the benefits of specialization already in the 18th century. Smith talked at the pin factory. You see a picture of a pin factory here and a quote from Adam Smith that nicely captures the concept of specialization. Now, it is a stretch to move from a pin factory to a subway restaurant. But let me try. What benefits might we get in our subway restaurant as a result of specialization? I propose that we would benefit in at least four ways. First, think of a reduction processing times due to elimination of setups. The time, so the various activities might be reduced and that's the capacity levels increase as workers specialize in fewer activities. For example, an employee who is doing all the activities might have to take off his gloves when he switches between touching a sandwich and operating the cash register, which would increase his or her processing time. The person who does nothing but operate the cash register will not face such an inconvenience. Oftentimes, such disruptions are referred to as setup times. Second, I can imagine a reduction in processing times due to learning. If you cut 1,000 tomatoes per day chances are you'll get pretty good at that. Simply put, practice makes perfect, and this perfection also manifests itself in shorter processing times. Third, we can potentially get away with lower skilled labor. More specialized labor tends to require shorter training period and oftentimes receives lower wages. It takes less time to teach an employee how to assemble a rear view mirror compared to teaching her how to assemble an entire car. Even if specialization does not decrease the processing times, it can still save us money. Finally, I think about the need for equipment replication. Another benefit of the specialized process flow relates to the amount of equipment that is needed to operate the process. Six parallel station in which each employee carries out all the activities would require that each employee you would get her own equipment, including a cash register, which is rather expensive. Again, all of these benefits have to be weighed against the cost of specialization. As we specialize, the idle time is going up, which at least to me was somewhat counter-intuitive. Moreover, the coordination needs and the interdependence among the workers are increasing. If I have only one person who can slice tomatoes and that person does not show up for the job, I have a problem. In contrast, if each employee is capable of making a whole sandwich from beginning to end, my process is much more robust. This might not be a big deal in the production of a sandwich, but it's a super hot topic in producing cars and phones in today's global and interdependent supply chains. Enough about the 18th Century. In the next video, we'll talk about flying to Mars, it should be a nice contrast to this aggression in history. See you then.
