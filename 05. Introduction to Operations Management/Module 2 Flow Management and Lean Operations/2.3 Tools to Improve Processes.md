## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块2 - 流程管理和精益运营

### 课程2.3 流程改进工具

通过**流程改进工具**（减轻瓶颈、平衡生产线、专业化分工）与**节拍时间（Takt Time）** 概念，结合Subway餐厅案例与历史理论（亚当·斯密分工理论），揭示如何通过科学方法提升流程效率与灵活性，核心是掌握**需求驱动**的优化策略。

#### 1. 流程改进的三大工具

##### 1.1 减轻瓶颈负担（Offloading the Bottleneck）  

- **核心思想**：瓶颈决定整体产能，通过重新分配任务或技术手段释放其压力。  
- **案例**：  
  - **童子军徒步**：通过分担负重（Herbie的背包）提升整体行进速度。  
  - **Subway餐厅**：自动化瓶颈环节（如酱料分配机）或外包部分任务（如预包装调料）。  
- **实施方式**：  
  - **任务重分配**：将瓶颈环节的部分工作转移至非瓶颈资源。  
  - **技术引入**：自动化设备减少人工处理时间（如麦当劳酱料机）。  
  - **外包/预加工**：采购半成品减少现场操作步骤。  

##### 1.2 节拍时间（Takt Time）与生产线平衡（Line Balancing）  

- **节拍时间定义**：满足需求所需的生产节奏 = 可用时间 / 需求量。  
  - **案例**：Subway需求160个/小时 → 节拍时间=3600秒/160≈22.5秒/个。  
- **目标人力计算**：  
  - **公式**：目标人力 = 总劳动内容（Labor Content） / 节拍时间 → Subway案例：120秒/22.5秒≈5.33人 → 实际需7人（因任务不可拆分）。  
- **平衡逻辑**：将任务拆分为不超过节拍时间的区块，分配至各资源（员工），确保流程同步。  

##### 1.3 专业化分工（Specialization）  
- **理论来源**：亚当·斯密《国富论》中别针工厂案例，强调分工提升效率。  
- **Subway应用优势**：  
  - **减少切换成本**：避免频繁更换手套或工具（如收银员专注收银）。  
  - **学习曲线效应**：重复操作缩短处理时间（如专职切番茄员工效率提升）。  
  - **降低技能门槛**：简化培训（如仅培训组装后视镜而非整车）。  
  - **设备成本节约**：避免重复购置设备（如仅需1台收银机而非多台）。  
- **缺点**：  
  - **闲置时间增加**：分工细化导致非瓶颈资源闲置（如Subway案例中7人分工后总闲置时间27秒/个，高于3人分工的18秒）。  
  - **协调风险**：依赖单一技能员工（如番茄切割员缺勤导致产线停滞）。  

#### 2. 关键结论与启示

##### 2.1 瓶颈优化的杠杆效应

- 微小改进（如Subway瓶颈时间减少3秒）可显著提升利润（案例中利润增长78%）。  
- **行动优先级**：通过时间研究（Time Study）识别瓶颈任务，优先优化。  

##### 2.2 节拍时间驱动资源规划  

- 节拍时间反映市场需求节奏，是动态调整人力的基准（如Subway午餐高峰需7人，非高峰减少）。  
- **陷阱警示**：过度分工虽提升专业化，但增加闲置与协调成本，需权衡灵活性与效率。  

##### 2.3 历史理论与现代实践的结合  

- 亚当·斯密的分工理论在服务业（如快餐）与制造业（如汽车）中仍适用，但需适配柔性需求（如定制化服务）。  

#### 3. 行业应用与行动建议

##### 3.1 制造业  

- **汽车装配线**：通过节拍时间匹配市场需求（如特斯拉根据订单调整生产节奏），避免库存积压。  
- **设备利用率（OEE）**：监控瓶颈设备停机时间，减少六大损失（故障、换型等）。  

##### 3.2 服务业  

- **医院急诊科**：使用%-VAT（增值时间占比）分析患者流程时间，减少非医疗等待（如文书处理）。  
- **快餐连锁**：动态调整节拍时间（如午餐高峰缩短至20秒/个），灵活调配兼职员工。  

##### 3.3 通用策略  

- **跨部门协作**：供应链与运营部门协同，确保供应商节拍匹配生产瓶颈（如JIT交付）。  
- **技术赋能**：引入IoT设备实时监控瓶颈环节，自动触发调整（如库存预警补货）。  

--- 

#### 总结
 
流程改进的本质是**在效率与灵活性间寻找平衡**。Subway案例表明，通过科学拆解任务（节拍时间）、释放瓶颈压力与合理分工，可显著提升产能；而历史理论提醒我们，需警惕过度分工的隐性成本。核心策略始终是：**以需求为锚点，数据为驱动，持续迭代优化**。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

### 第一章: Optimizing Flow Management

#### 视频小节3: Tools to Improve Processes

字幕文本: 

The reason why we analyze processes, the reason why we compute things such as idle time and labor utilization levels or the cost of direct labor, is of course to improve the process. We want to make things better. In today's video, I will introduce three tools will help you improve your process. I will refer to them as offloading the bottleneck, balancing the line using tech time, and we'll talk about specialization. Let's start with the idea of offloading the bottleneck. In 1984, Ellie Goldratt, wrote a highly successful book entitled The Goal. Hard to believe, that the book is about operations management as in operations management textbook written as a novel. Unlike my books, it has sold millions of copies. The hero of the book is a fictitious plant manager by the name of Alex, who discovers the principles of process analysis. Alex has this epiphany when he takes a group of boy scouts for hike in the forest. The group takes a single file path and search as close to each other. But the longer they march, the more the group spreads out. The boys in the front tend to be the fast ones as they work at their own rate leaving the others behind. One chubby scout by the name of Herbie is holding the group back. He has hundreds of meters of empty trail in front of him, and a group of impatient boy scouts, that due to the narrowness of the trail cannot overtake him, behind him. Alex realizes that this hike has a lot in common with this production process. He associates the speed with which the entire group is moving with the flow rate in the plant. Just as a plant cannot produce faster than the bottleneck, the group of boy scouts cannot walk faster than Herbie. Any process improvement starts by looking at the bottleneck. In the case of Herbie, Alex soon found out that this ability to walk as fast as the other kids was not just constrained by his pure physiological limitations, but also by Herbie carrying a rather large and heavy backpack with plenty of snacks inside. To improve the hiking speed of the group, Alex then takes Herbie's backpack and puts the content up among the other faster scouts. Yes, those scouts are now slowed down a bit, but Herbie is able to walk faster, and that is all that counts. In general, we refer to the improvement strategy of moving work away from the bottleneck as offloading the bottleneck. Offloading the bottleneck can take multiple forms. First we can think about reassigning activities to other resources with more capacity, an improvement strategy that we will refer to in a moment as line balancing. Second, we can think about automating some of the activities, consuming time at the bottleneck by using technology. For example, we might be able to automate the dispensing of a wrapping paper, which has a potential of reducing the processing time for employee number 2. As a side note, McDonald's key innovations on their way to becoming the fast food empire, was the invention of a condiment dispenser, which will provide an exact supply of ketchup or mayonnaise by the pressing of a button. We can think about outsourcing, some of the activities consuming time at the bottleneck. Imagine if it would be possible to put the condiments in the back at the beginning of the ship, or to even purchase bags that are already loaded with condiments. This would reduce a time for employee 2 which, given that employee 2 is a bottleneck, would increase the capacity of the process. Next, let's turn to line balancing and tack time. In our prior calculations, we found the capacity of the three-person line to be about 78 sandwiches per hour. What are you doing when demand is higher? The busy stores at lunchtime have demands all the way up to 160 sandwiches an hour. For that, well, we clearly need more labor. I want you to wrestle with two questions while you put me on pause. The first one is about the cycle time. What cycle time do you need to hit to serve 160 customers per hour? The second one is on staffing, how many workers will you need? Put me on pause now. Here we go again. Let's get this done together. What cycle time do you need to meet the demand of 160 sandwiches per hour? Well, there are 3,600 seconds in an hour, and I want to make myself 160 sandwiches during this hour. The hours cancels out, and I'm going to get 22.5 seconds per sandwich. That is the cycle time I need to achieve to meet demand. In a moment, we're going to refer to this number as the tact time. That's going to be the tact of demand. Tact really tells us how fast we have to run, and then what cadence we have to operate to be in sync with demand. That's the whole idea of tact. Tact also helps us find out how many people we need to hire at the very minimum. That number is not going to be an exact number, but it gives us a lower bound. The logic behind this is as follows. We're going to look here at 120 seconds of labor that I know are in a sandwich. That is our labor conduct, 120 seconds per unit. We're going to divide it by the tact time, the 22.5 seconds per unit. We have seconds per unit in the nominator, and also seconds per unit in the denominator, so that cancels out. We're going to get a staffing level of a minimum of 5.33. If we round this up to the next integer, I see that at the minimum, I need six workers. It's not going to go exact, but it's the target. We're going to see in the next slide, that actually we'll need a little bit more labor than that. This number really provides a first good shot. Let me formalize this. We formally now define tact time as the ratio between the available time and the demand rate. Available time was in our example 3,600 seconds per hour. We want to have 160 units per hour of demand, so the takt is 22.5 seconds per unit. The word takt comes from the German word takt, which is used in the musical world. We want to make sure that not every musician is playing at his or her own pace, but everybody stays in sync. I think it's very appropriate to use the word takt in the case of process analysis. Let me emphasize. A takt time is an ambition, it is a target. It does not depend on the capacity or the capability of the process, it's just churning demand into a target cycle time for the process. Once we have done the takt time, we can compute the target manpower. The target manpower is resource a ratio between the labor content and the takt time. In our case, it was 5.3 feet person, which was 120 seconds of labor content, divided by 22.5 seconds of the takt per unit. Ideally, we would like to hire 5.33 persons. Since you cannot hire a third of a worker, this is clearly not feasible, and we were rounding this up to six. As we will see in a moment, even six might not be enough. The reason for that is at work cannot easily be divided into smaller chunks. For example, the cash register operation here, that takes 20 seconds. That is a block or a chunk that we cannot move easily forth and back. As you'll notice when you're allocating the activities across the resources here, the employees, even the bottleneck has some slack, has some idle time relative to the takt time. Again, line balancing means that you take the takt time 22.5 seconds in our example, and then you spread out the activities from grading the customer all the way to the cash register, subject to the constraint that no individual should have more work and their processing time than the takt time. If you notice you're going above the takt time, well, then you just move the work to the next resource and continue until you found out that in this case would actually need seven employees. Now let me point out some subtlety that I find somewhat counter-intuitive. It's counter-intuitive at least for me, I'm not sure about you. Here because of the demand rate, we said that even the bottleneck would have some idle time. Let's ignore that. Let's make us capacity constraint and assume that we're running at the rate of the bottleneck, which is producing a unit every 21 seconds. We can then compute how much idle time each of the workers has. It's going to be five seconds for the first worker, zero for the second worker, two seconds here for the next one, seven seconds, five seconds, seven seconds, and one second. Now, how much idle time do we now have? We have 5+0+2+7+5+7+1. We have 27 seconds per unit of idle time. Do you remember how much idle time we had with three workers? It was 18. Well, less than the 27. As we specialize, that idle time is going to go up. The more workers take on the work, the harder will it be to find a perfect balance. As I said, I find this counter-intuitive. Today, we talked about improvement strategies. We talked about offloading the bottleneck, and we talked about balancing the line using the concept of takt time. We have not yet talked about specialization. Here we go. Adam Smith a famous philosopher and economist wrote about the benefits of specialization already in the 18th century. Smith talked at the pin factory. You see a picture of a pin factory here and a quote from Adam Smith that nicely captures the concept of specialization. Now, it is a stretch to move from a pin factory to a subway restaurant. But let me try. What benefits might we get in our subway restaurant as a result of specialization? I propose that we would benefit in at least four ways. First, think of a reduction processing times due to elimination of setups. The time, so the various activities might be reduced and that's the capacity levels increase as workers specialize in fewer activities. For example, an employee who is doing all the activities might have to take off his gloves when he switches between touching a sandwich and operating the cash register, which would increase his or her processing time. The person who does nothing but operate the cash register will not face such an inconvenience. Oftentimes, such disruptions are referred to as setup times. Second, I can imagine a reduction in processing times due to learning. If you cut 1,000 tomatoes per day chances are you'll get pretty good at that. Simply put, practice makes perfect, and this perfection also manifests itself in shorter processing times. Third, we can potentially get away with lower skilled labor. More specialized labor tends to require shorter training period and oftentimes receives lower wages. It takes less time to teach an employee how to assemble a rear view mirror compared to teaching her how to assemble an entire car. Even if specialization does not decrease the processing times, it can still save us money. Finally, I think about the need for equipment replication. Another benefit of the specialized process flow relates to the amount of equipment that is needed to operate the process. Six parallel station in which each employee carries out all the activities would require that each employee you would get her own equipment, including a cash register, which is rather expensive. Again, all of these benefits have to be weighed against the cost of specialization. As we specialize, the idle time is going up, which at least to me was somewhat counter-intuitive. Moreover, the coordination needs and the interdependence among the workers are increasing. If I have only one person who can slice tomatoes and that person does not show up for the job, I have a problem. In contrast, if each employee is capable of making a whole sandwich from beginning to end, my process is much more robust. This might not be a big deal in the production of a sandwich, but it's a super hot topic in producing cars and phones in today's global and interdependent supply chains. Enough about the 18th Century. In the next video, we'll talk about flying to Mars, it should be a nice contrast to this aggression in history. See you then.
