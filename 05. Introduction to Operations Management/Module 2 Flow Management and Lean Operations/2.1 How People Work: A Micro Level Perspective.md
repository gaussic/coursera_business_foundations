### 核心概念与框架  
1. **周期时间（Cycle Time）与流程速率（Flow Rate）**  
   • **周期时间**：完成一个流程单元（如一个三明治）所需的时间（秒/单位）。  
     ◦ 计算公式：`周期时间 = 1 / 流程速率`。  
     ◦ **案例（Subway）**：瓶颈环节（员工2）的处理时间为46秒/三明治，故周期时间为**46秒/单位**，即每46秒生产一个三明治。  
   • **流程速率**：单位时间内的产出量（单位/小时）。  
     ◦ **案例（Subway）**：瓶颈产能为78三明治/小时，故流程速率=min(需求, 瓶颈产能)=78单位/小时。  

2. **劳动力利用率（Labor Utilization）**  
   • **定义**：实际产出（流程速率）与资源最大产能的比值，反映资源使用效率。  
   • **计算**：`利用率 = 流程速率 / 资源产能`。  
     ◦ **案例（Subway）**：  
       ◦ 员工1产能=97三明治/小时，员工2=78三明治/小时（瓶颈），员工3=97三明治/小时。  
       ◦ 当需求为100三明治/小时时：  
         ▪ 员工1利用率=78/97≈80%；员工2=100%；员工3≈80%。  

3. **直接劳动力成本（Direct Labor Cost）与劳动力内容（Labor Content）**  
   • **劳动力内容**：生产一个单位所需的总人工时间。  
     ◦ **案例（Subway）**：三个员工总处理时间=37+46+37=120秒/三明治。  
   • **劳动力成本**：结合劳动力内容与员工时薪计算单位成本。  

---

### 工具应用与案例分析  
4. **流程流图与瓶颈识别（Subway案例）**  
   • **流程步骤分解**：  
     1. 员工1：处理时间37秒（切片面包、加配料）。  
     2. 员工2：处理时间46秒（添加配菜、包装）→ **瓶颈**。  
     3. 员工3：处理时间37秒（收银）。  
   • **流程流图绘制**：  
     ◦ 三角形（等待顾客）→ 员工1 → 缓冲区 → 员工2 → 缓冲区 → 员工3。  
   • **瓶颈影响**：即使员工1和3产能更高，整体流程速率由员工2的46秒/单位决定。  

5. **批量生产时间计算**  
   • **公式**：总时间 = 第一个单位完成时间 + (数量-1) × 周期时间。  
   • **案例**：20个三明治的总时间 = 120秒（第一个） + 19×46秒 = **994秒**（约16.5分钟）。

### 关键结论  
1. **瓶颈决定整体效率**：  
   • 即使非瓶颈环节效率高，系统产出仍受限于最慢环节（如Subway员工2）。优化瓶颈可显著提升产能（如简化配菜步骤或增加员工）。  

2. **周期时间与流程速率的动态平衡**：  
   • 周期时间缩短可直接提升流程速率（如从46秒→40秒，产能从78→90单位/小时）。  
   • 当需求波动时，灵活调整资源配置（如高峰时段增加员工）。  

3. **劳动力利用率的管理意义**：  
   • 高利用率（如员工2的100%）提示资源满负荷，需警惕超负荷风险（如员工疲劳导致错误）。  
   • 低利用率（如员工1和3的80%）表明存在闲置产能，可通过任务分配优化（如让员工1协助其他环节）。  

4. **精益生产的核心：消除浪费**：  
   • **时间浪费**：通过流程流图识别非增值步骤（如等待时间）。  
   • **劳动力浪费**：标准化操作（如Subway的装配线分工）减少重复动作。  

5. **数据驱动的决策流程**：  
   • 使用工具（如Excel）量化处理时间、产能、利用率，支持科学管理。  
   • 实际应用：计算目标人力（Takt Time=可用时间/需求，目标人力=总劳动力内容/Takt Time）。  

**最终目标**：通过微观流程分析，实现**高效率（缩短周期时间）、低成本（优化劳动力）、高响应（灵活应对需求）**的精益运营体系。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

### 第一章: Optimizing Flow Management

#### 视频小节1: How People Work: A Micro Level Perspective

字幕文本: 

In this module, we'll look at the operations of a process at the very micro level. We get our all stopwatch and look second by second on how people work. The case study I've picked for this module is Subway restaurants. I somewhat assume that all of you have eaten in a Subway restaurant or similar venues, so it should make for a good case study. I also assume that every one of us has made a sandwich for ourselves. Now, unless you're a professional cook or have a big family, your experience is all about making one sandwich at a time. How long does it take you? What is your processing time? How long does it take you to slice the bread? Here's some official Subway information of how long it takes to make a sandwich. This will vary a bit by sandwich and employee, but let's just take these numbers as given for now. We see that we have a grand total of 120 seconds of work per sandwich. That is two minutes. In other words, one employee could make a sandwich every two minutes, which is equal to 30 sandwiches an hour. That's the employee's capacity. But what would Subway do when demand is higher than this? Maybe 80 or even 100 sandwiches per hour, which are common numbers during busy lunchtimes. Well, they certainly need more employees to do this. But how should we organize the workflow? Say they hired two more employees, so they now have three. One thing that they could do is that each of the three employees serves a customer from beginning to end, from greeting the customer all the way to checkout. Each employee would then take 120 seconds to serve a customer. Interestingly, that is not the process that they use. And we later on, we'll understand the logic behind this. For now, here's what they are actually doing. Take a look. What Subway does is here, rather than having one person doing the whole thing, making the whole sandwich, they have three people involved in the job. They're really setting up a mini assembly line of sandwiches consisting of employee one, two, and three. Each of them has their hands in our sandwich, yummy. So the first employee is greeting the customer. And then employee one does all the things up to putting the cheese on the sandwich. Then the second employee takes over, and that person starts with putting on the onions and goes all the way up to wrapping up and bagging the sandwich. And then the third employee is going to offer the fresh value meal and then rings out the cash register. That completes one customer. So for now, let's say the numbers here, these processing times are exact. I know this is a very mechanical view to the world, but as you will see, it is a good start. It takes exactly these 12 seconds to put on the meat. It takes 37 seconds per sandwich, per unit, per guest at employee number one. The processing time is 46 seconds per unit for the employee number two and 37 seconds per unit at employee number three. So these are the processing times. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to draw me a process flow diagram of this Subway assembly line for sandwiches. And then, I want you to think about the capacity of this process. As usual, put me on hold, pause me, and then see how far you can get this done by yourself.

All right, here we go. Let's look at this together. Let's start by drawing the process flow diagram. For the process flow diagram, we start out with a triangle of waiting customers. So that's a triangle. Then comes the first box. The first resource, that's going to be employee number one. There could be a buffer then we have employee number two afterwards. So that's the second resource, the second box. And after that, there's another buffer, and that is the other employee number three. And that completes the process flow diagram. So we have three resources. Next up, I want you to think about the capacity of this process. For the capacity of the process, I have to find the bottleneck. It's going to be one of these three workers. Each of them has a capacity. We're going to find it by taking one over the processing time. So 1/37 is a capacity of the first worker, and that is in sandwiches per second. 1/46 sandwiches per second is a capacity of the second ute, and 1/37 is the third. So we see here that the lowest number is 1/46. And so that is, by definition, our bottleneck. Rather than messing around with mental math, let's switch over into Excel and do this on a spreadsheet. We have the three workers, the three resources here, and each of them has a processing time. And remember, those were 37, 46, 37 seconds per unit. Let's make sure we keep track of the units here. These are all in seconds per unit. Now, the capacity we set is simply one over the processing time. So 1/37, and that is 0.027027. That's a really hard to interpret number. This is expressed now in units per second. And to make it easier to interpret I would suggest we just convert it to units per hour. We do this by simply multiplying this number by 3600, right? 3600 seconds in an hour. And 97 sandwiches per hour is a number that is much easier to interpret. So remember then, the process capacity we set, the process capacity is simply the minimum of these individual capacity levels. That was the whole idea of the bottleneck. The bottleneck, not surprisingly, is at station number two, and the process capacity is 78 units per hour. From there, the next thing that we want to think about is flow rate. Flow rate we said was the minimum of demand and capacity. So we need to make an assumption about the demand rate. Let's say for now the demand is 100 sandwiches per hour. And so that means our flow rate is the law of these two numbers. But the minimum between demand and capacity and the flow rate now, is this going to be 78 units per hour. We also talked about the idea of utilization. So for utilization, I'm taking my flow rate. So I'm fixing the 78 and I fix them in Excel by pressing the dollar sign and I'm dividing it by the capacity. So that means my first resource has a utilization of about 80%. And then the other resources have a utilization of 100% and 80% respectively. Now, just for intuition building, imagine my demand rate would go down. Say we have a demand of 50 customers per hour. Then my utilization, even at the bottom neck, would decrease to a value that is less than one. In fact, with the demand of 50, it would go down as you see here to about 63%. But for now, let's not worry about that. Let's go back to the base case of demand being 100, so we have a utilization of 100% at the bottleneck and about 80% at the other two resources. Next up, I want to define a new measure, and I will define the new measure as the cycle time. Let me define cycle time as one over the flow rate. Let's be very careful with the units here. I've been a little sloppy in the last rows keeping track of the units. Flow rate is measured in units per hour. And so my cycle time, since it's one over the flow rate, is now hours per unit. Now 0.12778 hours go by between two making of two sandwiches. It's a little hard to interpret. So I suggest we just convert this back into seconds and we divide the 3600 seconds of the hour by 78 sandwiches. Now we see something that I hope is intuitive as we are now back to our seconds per unit. Our cycle time is 46 seconds per unit, and that means we are making a sandwich every 46 seconds. So work repeats itself. We are cycling through every 46 seconds to make a new sandwich. Now that we have the cycle time, I want to ask you another question. Imagine we have a school bus with 20 hungry kids arrive at the Subway restaurant. Every kid wants one sandwich, and right now the restaurant is totally empty. How long will it take to please the crowd? How long will it take to make 20 sandwiches starting with an empty process. This is harder than it sounds. So let's think about this systematically. How long will it take to feed the first kid? Well, the first kit the first customer in order to be served, we need to basically go through all three steps. 37 seconds at station one, 46 at station two, and 37 seconds at station three. Now, how much later will we please a second customer? Think about that. The second customer will come out 46 seconds later and another 46 seconds later comes out the third customer. So from then onwards, we are completing a customer order every 46 seconds. That is exactly the idea of cycle time. So to please a crowd of 20 customers, to feed 20 customers, we're going to have to feed the first one and then 19 times more we're going to go through the cycle time till we have completed the total order of 20 units. That will be after 994 seconds. Before advancing further, I would like to review the calculations that we did in Excel a moment ago. Remember, we have these three resources with processing times 37, 46 and 37 seconds per unit. I try to visualize this here in this graph with 37, 46 and 37. As these bars, we can imagine already that station two is going to be the bottleneck, but that would be jumping ahead. The bottleneck is defined based on capacity, not based on processing time. So to find the capacity of a resource, we look at the number of peril servers at that resource M divided by the processing time. Now here each resource, each station is really stuffed by one employee. And so my capacity level is 1/37, and that is expressed in sandwiches per second. 1/46 and 1/47. That makes this step here the lowest number. And so employee two is going to be the bottleneck. So my process capacity sands 1/46 sandwiches per second. For now, I want to leave it in seconds as opposed to converting it to hours as I did in the Excel spreadsheet. And you will see why in just a moment.

That gives me my process capacity and we assume there's plenty of demand. So my flow rate is, as usual, minimum between demand and process capacity. Again, this is going to be driven by the capacity of the bottleneck. Next up, I'm going to look at the utilization. And the utilization is the flow rate, which is going to be one over 46 divided by the capacity levels. And so for the first resource, that's going to be 1/46 divided by 1/37. And that means 37 divided by 46. For the second resource, it is 1/46. Again, fluoride divided by capacity, which is also 1/46. So the utilization there is one. And then for the third employee, it's again 1/46 divided by 1/37. And that gives me again 37 divided by 46, which we said is around 80%.

Next, let's look at the cycle time, which is what we said was 1/flow rate. And here's why I didn't convert it into hours. If you write it this way, it's quite simple. The cycle time is simply 1/flow rate. And the flow rate was 1/46. So all that combined gives us a cycle time of 46 seconds per sandwich. Every 46 seconds, life repeats itself. And then finally to make 20 units, starting with an empty process, we have to first produce the first sandwich. And for the first sandwich, it's going to take us 37 plus 46 plus 37, which together gets us 120 seconds. So after 120 seconds, we have one sandwich. So now we need 19 times an additional sandwich. And guess what? We're making those on a 46 second cycle. So we have 120 plus 19 times 46, which gets us to the 994 seconds. So far with the Subway case, we mainly repeated our capacity calculation. I also introduced the concept of cycle time. Please, be careful with the word cycle time. I've seen it used very differently across industry. Most importantly, I've come across some companies that use the word cycle time for what we call flow time. Now, not surprisingly, I think my definition is the right one. The word cycle time in my view captures the idea of a cycle. Every 46 seconds a process in our Subway case repeats itself. Every 46 seconds a new cycle begins. The cycle time is particularly useful for processes with discrete flow units. I wouldn't use the concept in an oil refinery or a brewery. It just works better when you're dealing with customers or widgets or sandwiches. The cycle time helps us find how long it would take to produce a certain number of units, starting with an empty system. As we will see, the cyclotime also will be at the heart of some further productivity calculations. Speaking of further calculations, in the next video we will talk more about the importance of labor productivity. I will introduce two new measures and then we will link those to financial performance. See you then.
