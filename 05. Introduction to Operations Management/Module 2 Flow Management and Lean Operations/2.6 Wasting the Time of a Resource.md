### 课程2.6 浪费资源的时间

以**医疗ICU病房**和**航空业**为案例，系统解析了如何通过**OEE（整体设备效率）**衡量资源时间浪费，并提出了**增值活动与非增值活动**的区分框架。

#### 1. OEE框架的核心逻辑与应用

##### 1.1 OEE的定义与计算

- **公式**：  
  \[
  \text{OEE} = \text{可用率（Availability）} \times \text{性能率（Performance）} \times \text{合格率（Quality）}
  \]  
  - **可用率**：衡量设备实际运行时间占计划生产时间的比例（如ICU病床82%的时间用于救治，剩余18%为空置或等待清洁）。  
  - **性能率**：对比实际产量与理论最大产能（如飞机仅1/3时间在飞行，其余用于登机、维护等非增值活动）。  
  - **合格率**：合格品占总产量的比例（医疗案例中隐含「无效治疗时间」可能未被计入浪费）。  

##### 1.2 OEE的实践意义

- **产能释放**：若OEE为50%，理论上可通过优化实现产能翻倍或资源减半。  
- **成本节约**：识别资源闲置（如ICU病床等待清洁）、低效运行（如飞机滑行时间过长）等浪费，降低运营成本。  
- **精益管理工具**：通过数据驱动决策，优化设备维护计划（如预防性维护减少停机）和排产策略（如高优先级订单分配至高OEE设备）。

#### 2. 资源时间浪费的分类与案例

##### 2.1 医疗场景中的浪费

- **显性浪费**：病床空置、等待清洁或患者转运（ICU案例中占比18%）。  
- **隐性浪费**：  
  - **非必要治疗时间**：患者使用呼吸机超时但未及时调整（需结合临床判断区分「增值」与「非增值」）。  
  - **行政流程**：重复登记、身份核验等未直接改善患者健康的活动（类似Ohno定义的「非增值但必要工作」）。  

##### 2.2 航空业的浪费分析

- **飞机滑行时间**：日均1.5小时滑行（占全天6.25%）属于「必要但非增值」活动。  
- **登机与维护**：虽需保障安全，但可通过流程优化缩短时间（如快速登机系统或预测性维护）。

#### 3. 增值与非增值活动的界定挑战  

##### 3.1 大野耐一的浪费理论

- **七大浪费**：过度生产、等待、运输、库存、过度加工、缺陷、不必要的移动。  
- **ICU案例映射**：  
  - **等待浪费**：患者转运延迟、设备清洁排队。  
  - **过度加工**：呼吸机使用超时（未及时调整治疗方案）。  

##### 3.2 客户价值视角的权衡

- **增值活动**：直接提升客户支付意愿的行为（如ICU救治、飞机载客飞行）。  
- **非增值但必要活动**：法规要求的身份核验、安全维护等（需通过技术创新压缩耗时，如生物识别替代人工核验）。

#### 4. OEE的局限性及应对策略

##### 4.1 数据收集的挑战

- **人工观察成本高**：如ICU案例需学生每小时记录病床状态，难以规模化。  
- **主观判断偏差**：区分「必要」与「不必要」活动依赖经验（如呼吸机使用时长是否合理）。  

##### 4.2 改进方向

- **自动化监控**：IoT传感器实时采集设备状态（如飞机滑行数据、病床占用率），减少人工记录误差。  
- **动态调整标准**：结合行业基准（如航空业OEE 33%）与内部历史数据，设定阶段性改进目标。

#### 关键结论与行动指南

1. **OEE作为诊断工具**：  
   - 优先优化可用率（减少停机）和性能率（提升运行速度），再追求质量改进（如医疗案例中优先缩短病床清洁时间）。  
2. **精益思维贯穿流程**：  
   - 应用大野耐一的「现场主义」（现地现物），通过观察员工动作识别隐性浪费（如重复搬运、无效移动）。  
3. **技术创新驱动效率**：  
   - 引入预测性维护（减少计划外停机）和自动化流程（如自助值机缩短登机时间）。  
4. **客户价值导向**：  
   - 定期评估非增值活动的必要性（如医疗中的行政流程能否数字化），确保资源聚焦于核心价值创造环节。  

通过OEE分析与精益工具的结合，企业可系统性释放资源潜力，实现从「减少显性浪费」到「重构价值链」的跨越式改进。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

#### 视频小节2: Wasting the Time of a Resource

字幕文本: 

As I mentioned in the opening video, we need to be mindful of the time that is wasted at resources, as well as the time that is wasted by our customers, by our flow unit. Today, we will start looking at the time wasted at a resource, again, I would like to start this video with a medical story. A number of years ago, my colleague Evan Fieldston and I, did a study in the ICU at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Our research question was simple, we wanted to know what fraction of time an ICU bed was used to provide the care it can and should provide, and how much of the time was wasted. As we were launching our study, I felt reminded of Taylor's words, waste of times leave nothing tangible behind, how true? Where would we go and find the data of wasted time? Like in any modern operation, there was no shortage of data, medical records, billing records, hospital IT systems, you name it. But where would we find how much time was wasted? In our study of the ICU capacity at Shop, here's what Evan and I did. We found a motivated student, and that student would go to the ICU, and go around the beds every hour, over and over again. It's a really academic approach, and I feel somewhat guilty of asking our students to spend so much time, but I still think that this was the only way to get the job done. Anyway, this approach allowed us to collect thousands of hours of our observations on ICU beds and how they were used. We then classified these hours as follows, here you see the hours that we have data for, the hours the students observed. We then looked at the hours that from a medical perspective, were not really needed. That included the hours the bed was staffed, meaning it had a nurse assigned to it, but the bed was empty. Hours a kid in the bed was waiting for a transfer, and the hours that the bed was waiting for cleaning or an incoming kid. So in this case, we see that an ICU bed at Shop at that point was basically used about 82% of the time for the care that it was designed to deliver. That, by the way, is a really, really large number. I show you this data for two reasons. First, to introduce a new tool, and then to discuss the limitations of the tool. Now, this chart illustrates a method of really rigorously collecting data and analyzing value at time. You map out the total time that you have available at the resource, and then you subtract the time that you're comfortable defining as waste. We'll talk more about what exactly constitutes waste in the next video. For now, waste is the time that you feed is not adding value, it's not helping to get the kid healthy. We then can define the Overall Equipment Effectiveness, or OEE for short, of a resource as a percentage of time in which the available time of the resource is used productively, either resource is not wasting capacity. We can do this for any type of a resource, not just for equipment. You could do this for a machine, a factory worker, a lawyer, or an airplane. Second, let me also be upfront about the limitations of the tool. Again, let's go back to my ICU example. When we collected the data, we told the student that the kid in the bed that is on a ventilator always should be in the ICU. So any kid was observed in our study that was on a vent was coded as value add time. I think this was a plausible approach, but again, not without limitations. Imagine, for example, a kid being on the vent, but the vent really should have been disconnected a couple of hours ago, but the care team was busy taking care of another kid. And so, the vent never got disconnected or got disconnected six hours later. And so, you really have to ask yourself, are these six hours value add time or are they not? That gets me to the Ohno quote, moving is not working. I think this one is really deep, moving is not working. That means that even the dumbest consultant can look at a worker who is standing around idle and realize that that worker is not adding value. To look at a busy worker, however, somebody who is working, somebody who is moving, and determine how much of that work is really adding value, that is a lot harder. Now, according to Ohno, we can break up the time of workers that the workers are at work into two buckets, work and waste. Ohno defines waste as needless waste of time and worker movements that should be eliminated immediately. Again, more on this will come in the next video, but for now it's wasteful. Worker time minus waste gives us work, but really not all work is adding value. Ohno defined nonvalue at work as a work that was needed, but it's not directly adding value to the customer. Keep in mind, this framework originates from a production setting, but I think it's really quite universal, every process has a customer. So we can say that, non-value add work in a process is work that doesn't directly contribute to the willingness to pay from our customer. Such work might be needed, but not adding value to the customer, it is oftentimes referred to as incidental work. For example, the person that was checking me in during my radiology visit and confirming that I would be indeed the person who was on the prescription. Well, that was not outright wasteful, but we might imagine other ways to confirm my identity. And clearly, from my willingness to pay perspective, that check in didn't improve my health, my happiness, or my health outcome. All right, back to OEE. An OEE of 50% means that you can do twice as much work as you do right now with the same amount of resources. Or you can cut your resources in half and still serve the same number of customers. Now, if you're capacity constrained, these productivity improvements will really add to top line revenues. And if you're demand constraint, they really guide you to the way to save on operating costs. To give you a non-healthcare example of this, consider the OEE of an airplane. Airplanes are really expensive pieces of capital equipment as you want to get as much air time out of an airplane as possible. Here's an OEE chart for American Airlines Dallas Fort Worth. Every good consulting presentation that I've seen in operations has some version of this slide somewhere in the deck. So if you look at the 24 hours that are in a day, the plane is about one third of the time in the air, that's pretty impressive, by the way. And it's certainly much higher than what it was 20 years ago in the airline industry. Not to mention the situation in the summer of 2020 with the collapse of air travel that we've seen during COVID. Now, why is that? What happens during the other time? So, boarding, deplaning, maintenance, all of this stuff is clearly important, but it's not directly adding value, that is the idea of incidental activities. Personally, when I ran these numbers, I was most surprised by the taxi time, for really more than an hour and a half per day that 100 million dollar airplane is basically acting as a bus. All of us are busy, which means, we typically call for more resources. We want more staff, we want more equipment, we want more office space, more, and more, and more. Now, the OEE framework reminds us that our first job in process improvement is to get more out of our existing resources. An OEE of 50% means that we can double our capacity without adding more resources. The OEE framework is primarily there to help you organize data and the data collection from the front line. It tells you what to look for as you're looking for process improvement opportunities. Now, like any framework, the framework is not right or wrong, it is up to you and your data collection to decide what you make with it, but it supports the spirit of and. Go and see for yourself. In the next video, we'll talk about what to look for when you're at the front line looking for ways. See you then.
