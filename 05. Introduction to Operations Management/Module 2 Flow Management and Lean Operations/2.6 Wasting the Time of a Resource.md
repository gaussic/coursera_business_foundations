### 核心概念与工具  
1. **资源时间浪费的定义与分类**  
   • **定义**：资源（设备、人力、空间）未用于直接创造客户价值的活动。  
   • **分类**：  
     ◦ **显性浪费**：资源完全闲置（如ICU病床空置、飞机停飞）。  
     ◦ **隐性浪费**：资源执行非增值活动（如患者等待、飞机滑行）。  

2. **设备综合效率（OEE，Overall Equipment Effectiveness）**  
   • **公式**：  
     \[
     \text{OEE} = \frac{\text{增值时间}}{\text{总可用时间}} \times 100\%
     \]  
   • **应用场景**：  
     ◦ **医疗案例**：ICU病床的OEE为82%（增值时间：治疗；非增值时间：清洁、等待转院）。  
     ◦ **航空案例**：飞机每日仅1/3时间飞行（增值时间：载客飞行；非增值时间：登机、维护、滑行）。  

3. **增值与非增值工作的区分**  
   • **增值工作**：直接提升客户支付意愿的活动（如MRI检查、飞行服务）。  
   • **非增值工作**：  
     ◦ **必要但非增值**：如患者身份核验、飞机维护（需保留但可优化）。  
     ◦ **完全浪费**：如重复登记、设备空转（需消除）。

### 案例分析  
4. **ICU病床的时间浪费研究**  
   • **数据收集**：通过人工每小时记录病床使用状态，发现：  
     ◦ **82%时间用于治疗**（增值）；  
     ◦ **18%时间浪费**（空置、清洁、等待）。  
   • **启示**：高OEE（82%）仍存在隐性浪费（如患者等待转院），需通过流程优化压缩非增值时间。  

5. **航空业的OEE实践**  
   • **飞机每日时间分配**：  
     ◦ **增值时间**：8小时飞行；  
     ◦ **非增值时间**：1.5小时滑行、维护、登机等。  
   • **改进方向**：缩短滑行时间、优化维护流程（如夜间检修）。

### 关键结论  
1. **OEE的杠杆效应**：  
   • **OEE提升50%**意味着资源产能翻倍（如ICU病床服务量翻倍）或成本减半（如减少飞机数量同时维持运力）。  
   • **业务影响**：  
     ◦ **产能约束场景**：提升OEE直接增加收入（如医院接诊更多患者）；  
     ◦ **需求约束场景**：降低运营成本（如航空公司减少机队规模）。  

2. **隐性浪费的识别挑战**：  
   • **“移动≠工作”**（大野耐一）：忙碌≠增值（如医护人员填写表格、飞机滑行）。  
   • **数据驱动**：需通过实地观察（如人工记录、传感器监测）量化非增值时间，避免依赖系统日志的片面性。  

3. **改进策略**：  
   • **标准化流程**：减少必要但非增值工作（如自动化登记、优化维护流程）；  
   • **资源协同**：避免资源等待（如医院同步清洁与患者转院流程、航空公司优化地勤协作）。  

4. **文化变革**：  
   • **员工赋能**：鼓励一线员工识别浪费（如护士提出流程简化建议）；  
   • **客户中心化**：以客户时间线为标尺设计流程（如患者实时排队通知、航班快速登机方案）。  

**最终目标**：通过**OEE工具**与**双重视角分析**（资源与客户），将“隐形浪费”转化为可量化改进点，实现**资源效率最大化**与**客户体验最优化**。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

#### 视频小节2: Wasting the Time of a Resource

字幕文本: 

As I mentioned in the opening video, we need to be mindful of the time that is wasted at resources, as well as the time that is wasted by our customers, by our flow unit. Today, we will start looking at the time wasted at a resource, again, I would like to start this video with a medical story. A number of years ago, my colleague Evan Fieldston and I, did a study in the ICU at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Our research question was simple, we wanted to know what fraction of time an ICU bed was used to provide the care it can and should provide, and how much of the time was wasted. As we were launching our study, I felt reminded of Taylor's words, waste of times leave nothing tangible behind, how true? Where would we go and find the data of wasted time? Like in any modern operation, there was no shortage of data, medical records, billing records, hospital IT systems, you name it. But where would we find how much time was wasted? In our study of the ICU capacity at Shop, here's what Evan and I did. We found a motivated student, and that student would go to the ICU, and go around the beds every hour, over and over again. It's a really academic approach, and I feel somewhat guilty of asking our students to spend so much time, but I still think that this was the only way to get the job done. Anyway, this approach allowed us to collect thousands of hours of our observations on ICU beds and how they were used. We then classified these hours as follows, here you see the hours that we have data for, the hours the students observed. We then looked at the hours that from a medical perspective, were not really needed. That included the hours the bed was staffed, meaning it had a nurse assigned to it, but the bed was empty. Hours a kid in the bed was waiting for a transfer, and the hours that the bed was waiting for cleaning or an incoming kid. So in this case, we see that an ICU bed at Shop at that point was basically used about 82% of the time for the care that it was designed to deliver. That, by the way, is a really, really large number. I show you this data for two reasons. First, to introduce a new tool, and then to discuss the limitations of the tool. Now, this chart illustrates a method of really rigorously collecting data and analyzing value at time. You map out the total time that you have available at the resource, and then you subtract the time that you're comfortable defining as waste. We'll talk more about what exactly constitutes waste in the next video. For now, waste is the time that you feed is not adding value, it's not helping to get the kid healthy. We then can define the Overall Equipment Effectiveness, or OEE for short, of a resource as a percentage of time in which the available time of the resource is used productively, either resource is not wasting capacity. We can do this for any type of a resource, not just for equipment. You could do this for a machine, a factory worker, a lawyer, or an airplane. Second, let me also be upfront about the limitations of the tool. Again, let's go back to my ICU example. When we collected the data, we told the student that the kid in the bed that is on a ventilator always should be in the ICU. So any kid was observed in our study that was on a vent was coded as value add time. I think this was a plausible approach, but again, not without limitations. Imagine, for example, a kid being on the vent, but the vent really should have been disconnected a couple of hours ago, but the care team was busy taking care of another kid. And so, the vent never got disconnected or got disconnected six hours later. And so, you really have to ask yourself, are these six hours value add time or are they not? That gets me to the Ohno quote, moving is not working. I think this one is really deep, moving is not working. That means that even the dumbest consultant can look at a worker who is standing around idle and realize that that worker is not adding value. To look at a busy worker, however, somebody who is working, somebody who is moving, and determine how much of that work is really adding value, that is a lot harder. Now, according to Ohno, we can break up the time of workers that the workers are at work into two buckets, work and waste. Ohno defines waste as needless waste of time and worker movements that should be eliminated immediately. Again, more on this will come in the next video, but for now it's wasteful. Worker time minus waste gives us work, but really not all work is adding value. Ohno defined nonvalue at work as a work that was needed, but it's not directly adding value to the customer. Keep in mind, this framework originates from a production setting, but I think it's really quite universal, every process has a customer. So we can say that, non-value add work in a process is work that doesn't directly contribute to the willingness to pay from our customer. Such work might be needed, but not adding value to the customer, it is oftentimes referred to as incidental work. For example, the person that was checking me in during my radiology visit and confirming that I would be indeed the person who was on the prescription. Well, that was not outright wasteful, but we might imagine other ways to confirm my identity. And clearly, from my willingness to pay perspective, that check in didn't improve my health, my happiness, or my health outcome. All right, back to OEE. An OEE of 50% means that you can do twice as much work as you do right now with the same amount of resources. Or you can cut your resources in half and still serve the same number of customers. Now, if you're capacity constrained, these productivity improvements will really add to top line revenues. And if you're demand constraint, they really guide you to the way to save on operating costs. To give you a non-healthcare example of this, consider the OEE of an airplane. Airplanes are really expensive pieces of capital equipment as you want to get as much air time out of an airplane as possible. Here's an OEE chart for American Airlines Dallas Fort Worth. Every good consulting presentation that I've seen in operations has some version of this slide somewhere in the deck. So if you look at the 24 hours that are in a day, the plane is about one third of the time in the air, that's pretty impressive, by the way. And it's certainly much higher than what it was 20 years ago in the airline industry. Not to mention the situation in the summer of 2020 with the collapse of air travel that we've seen during COVID. Now, why is that? What happens during the other time? So, boarding, deplaning, maintenance, all of this stuff is clearly important, but it's not directly adding value, that is the idea of incidental activities. Personally, when I ran these numbers, I was most surprised by the taxi time, for really more than an hour and a half per day that 100 million dollar airplane is basically acting as a bus. All of us are busy, which means, we typically call for more resources. We want more staff, we want more equipment, we want more office space, more, and more, and more. Now, the OEE framework reminds us that our first job in process improvement is to get more out of our existing resources. An OEE of 50% means that we can double our capacity without adding more resources. The OEE framework is primarily there to help you organize data and the data collection from the front line. It tells you what to look for as you're looking for process improvement opportunities. Now, like any framework, the framework is not right or wrong, it is up to you and your data collection to decide what you make with it, but it supports the spirit of and. Go and see for yourself. In the next video, we'll talk about what to look for when you're at the front line looking for ways. See you then.
