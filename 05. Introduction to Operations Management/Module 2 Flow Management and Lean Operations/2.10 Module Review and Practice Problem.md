## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

### 第二章: Lean Operations

#### 视频小节6: Module Review and Practice Problem

字幕文本: 

Let's start today's video with some historical context about the Toyota production system and thus the automotive industry. I should have said this before, and I'm sure you have noticed this by now, but I use the term lean operations and the Toyota production system interchangeably. That doesn't mean that I try to sell you a Toyota Camry. It simply points to Toyota's success of developing a really powerful management system, again, more on that in a moment. But for now, let me start with a question. As a good German, I have to ask you this question do you know in which country the first car was designed and built? You guessed it, the first vehicle was built in Germany by a gentleman with the name of Carl Benz. In 1886, Carl Benz you see a picture of Carl Benz here built the first automotive vehicle, the Benz patent motor wagon. Benz was a real engineer who was passionate about the car. At that time my hypothesis is that he didn't care much about cycle time, idle time, and lime balance. It was all about making one beautiful car. The story about Carl Benz wouldn't be complete without talking about his wife Bertha, Bertha was actually the first driver. She drove from Mannheim, where I went to college, to Pforzheim and back, a 66 miles drive each way. Legend has that she ran out of gas on the way and for obvious reasons, there weren't any gas stations to refuel. So smart as Bertha was she went into the local pharmacy to get enough fuel to get back home to Mannheim. The second part of the automotive story I want to share is about Henry Ford. While Carl Benz was a master of the product, I would say Henry Ford was a master of the process. He had his epiphany for how to organize car production from visiting slaughterhouses. In slaughterhouses, meat is hanging from conveyor bells and is moved from one worker to the other. So good old Henry had the idea that something like that, based on a moving line, should work in an assembly operation. So Ford really perfected, in a very tailoristic mindset, the production of cars. He managed to bring the time that it took to build a car down from 12 hours to 2.5 hours. Ford relied heavily on specialization. Each worker would only be doing a very small job, like 60 seconds and less of work per car, which allowed Ford to take cheap immigrant labor off the streets and take them to quickly build up his production capacity. And so already 100 years ago, Ford was making well over a million vehicles per year. The most famous vehicle was a Model T, of which he had built 10 million units by 1924. He was really playing a game of scale economies. As Ford increased production, he was going down the learning curve and was squeezing the cost and the waste out of the system, that made the car affordable for the American middle class, which led to a period of prosperity and a widespread adoption of the automotive vehicle. The Toyota story is very different. Toyota was initially a company making automated looms. They went into the automotive industry just prior to World War II. 1937, they founded Toyota Motor Company. And as we know, there was a very difficult time for world history. We, the Germans, joined by the Japanese, started World War II. At the end of the war after 1945, the world lay in roots. And just like the US through the Marshall Plan, helped rebuild the German economy the US tried to help the Japanese economy. And that help included the attempt to establish an automotive industry. So what the Americans did is they took tools and experts from Detroit and transplanted them over to Japan, including Toyota. But that didn't go very well. And one of the reasons why this didn't work was that post World War II Japan had little domestic purchasing power that transcended into not having the demand, the scale that was so characteristic for the US market before, that spelled problems. For example, in 1950, Toyota made a grand total of 300 vehicles. They almost went bankrupt. Big crisis, worker strikes. It was really in that period of distress that the folks came together, heavily involved was this gentleman we talked about earlier on Taiichi Ohno and they started building what we now refer to as a Toyota production system. I review the Toyota production system in a moment. But to give you a sense of the impact that the Toyota production system had on industry, consider one last piece of data. In 1986, there was a big report published out of MIT from an institute called the International Motor Vehicle Program. A group of researchers went around the world benchmarking automotive plants, comparing their productivity levels. You see here the type of metrics that we discuss in this course, gross assembly hours per car for example, I think of as labor content. At the time a GM plant would have 40 hours of labor in a vehicle, a Toyota plant would have 18 defects, 130 to 45 most extreme inventories. Remember how we talked about days of supply and inventory turns? Two weeks worth of parts in a GM plant, two hours at Toyota. That meant that Toyota would turn the inventory multiple times in a day. And that was really the time when the world realized wow, there is just a smarter way of building a car. The lead author of this research study, a gentleman by the name of Jim Wumek, coined then the term lean operations. So again, Lean and Toyota has since emerged as synonyms. I have not done any automotive work in the United States, but I did research with a German and a French car manufacturer and both of those willingly admitted that they had embraced the Toyota production system. So what is a Toyota production system? There are many ways to visualize this but I think the most common form of summarizing and synthesizing the Toyota production system is in the shape of a house. There's a roof, and at the top of the roof is the idea of zero waste. The cool thing with the Toyota production system is you can impress people at cocktail parties with five or six words of Japanese. So the Japanese term for waste is muda. So zero waste is the top goal. Beyond waste, people oftentimes refer to four other zeros, zero defects, zero breakdowns, zero inventory, and zero setup times. Very much in the spirit of the seven sources of waste that we've discussed earlier on in this module. And then the main part of the house consists of two big pieces. There's a flow piece and there's a quality piece. The flow piece is all about matching supply with demand and avoiding inventory by delivering just in time. This includes things such as mixed model production, flow space at the rate of demand. Remember, we talked about TAC time, we talked about single units flow, we talked about push and pull, and we talked about Kanban. Again, lots of things that are really popping up throughout the scores. They're really all about the idea of flow. And then there's a piece about quality. Quality management has many elements to it. One big idea is really making sure that you catch defects as quickly as you can. And when we talk about quality in the quality module of this course, we'll go back to this idea. As we will see, Toyota workers are empowered to stop the line whenever there's a problem by pulling something that we will refer to as the unknown court. Finally, the house has a foundation. Depending on which book you read or which expert you ask, the foundations vary a little bit. I like to think about flexibility, standardization of work, and worker involvement. Worker involvement includes a famous idea of kaizen, I mentioned in passing earlier on in this module, the 8th source of waste, the intellect of the workforce should not be wasted. And so kaizen is all about involving the workforce in quality improvement circles and continuous improvement efforts. Standardization of work is related to many of the seven sources of waste. We make sure to standardize the one best way as opposed to having unnecessary motions. And then really this idea of flexibility, the ability that I can change over a machine from one type of car to another, or I have a worker with strained to do multiple things. This allows me to use a worker for multiple things, which makes it easier to balance the line. Okay, I know I'm out of time for this video as I did not manage to balance video durations well. So let me quickly summarize the learning objectives for this module. You see here the definitions related to the Toyota production system, only really two simple formulas the OEE and the flow time efficiency. So let's take a moment to practice those. One practice problem for each of those two formulas. Take a look at this first practice problem here about the cyclist and the wind tunnel. Put me on hold until you figured out the solution and then press play again.

All right, here we go. So we start by writing down the definition of the OEE. The OEE is simply the value at time, and we're going to divide this by the total time over the total time we pay the resource. I suggest we're going to use a ten day window here for reasons that will become clear in just a moment. So ten days and ten days are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour. So here in the denominator, we have the total number of minutes over those ten days. Now we have to look at when does work not happen, right? What do we have to take out? From these ten days there were only nine days that we were actually working, right? So nine days when work gets done. And then from these 110 or 20 minutes, from these 2 hours, 20 minutes are not adding value. So the procedures are each 100 minutes long in terms of their value add time. And how many procedures are we doing per day? Well, we only have five value add procedures a day because the other two are not adding value, they are a form of rework. And then type this into your calculator and you get an OEE of 0.3125. All right, the next problem is about the percent value add time looking now from the perspective of the flow unit. As usual, put me on hold first.

Here we go again. Let's tackle this problem together. So again, this problem is about the percentage value add time. Remember that ratio is the ratio of the value add time. And we're going to divide that value add time by the flow time, right? How long the unit spends in the process. Let's start with the flow time. That is the time that it takes the country to renew the passport, that is two days, four days. And then down here, another three days, another two days, ten days for the printing, and finally another two days. You add all of this up and it's going to take 23 days. And how much value at work it's done over those 23 days. Well, we can debate a little bit about the ten minutes that is happening at the clerk, but it's such a small number, it will not matter. Let's give them credit for these ten minutes. And then there are two minutes for the printing, though that's a grand total of 12 minutes of value add time. And you divide it by the flow time and you get zero point zero zero something. No matter what it is, it is a very small number. All right, that was a long video and a long module. I hope I did not digress too much into the details of the automotive industry. In the spirit of lean, let me be quick here in my closing comments. Thank you for joining me in this module. I see you soon.
