## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块2 - 流程管理和精益运营

### 课程2.9 实现顺畅的流程

以**考试批改流程**和**汽车制造**为案例，系统解析了实现流程顺畅的三大核心策略——**推拉系统（Push vs. Pull）**、**混合模式生产（Mixed Model Production）**和**单件流（Single Unit Flows）**，并结合精益原则提出了流程优化的底层逻辑。

#### 1. 推拉系统（Push vs. Pull）与看板管理

##### 1.1 推动式系统的缺陷

- **库存积压**：上游资源（如助教Dawson按题目批量批改）因过度生产导致流程中段堆积大量半成品（如未批改完的试卷），形成浪费。  
- **瓶颈放大**：若上游资源（如制造工站1）产能高于下游瓶颈（工站2），推动式生产会加剧瓶颈压力，降低整体效率。  

##### 1.2 拉动式系统的优势

- **Kanban看板机制**：通过下游需求触发上游生产，例如汽车座椅的「准时制（JIT）供应」——当车辆进入组装工位时，电子信号触发供应商生产并配送座椅，实现零库存目标。  
- **控制库存上限**：看板卡（Kanban Card）作为「工作授权」，限制在制品数量（如容器大小），避免资源过度投入。  
- **应用场景**：适用于高价值、低切换成本的模块化生产（如汽车复杂部件）。  

#### 2. 混合模式生产（Heijunka）与均衡化

##### 2.1 批量生产的痛点

- **库存波动**：传统批量生产（如汽车厂先生产50辆轿车再切换至旅行车）导致库存周期性波动，平均库存水平高。  
- **资源利用率不均**：员工在批量切换时经历「冲刺与闲置」的交替，如旅行车专用零件安装工在轿车生产周期内完全停工。  

##### 2.2 混合生产的优化策略

- **小批量均衡化（Heijunka）**：按需求比例混合生产（如轿车与旅行车1:1交替），减少库存峰值并平衡工作量。  
- **降低切换成本**：通过柔性设备（如快速换模技术）和标准化流程，将切换时间趋近于零，支持单件流（Batch Size=1）。  
- **案例**：丰田生产系统通过均衡化实现「乌龟式稳定节奏」，避免「野兔式冲刺-停滞」循环。  

#### 3. 单件流与运输批次优化

##### 3.1 单件流的核心逻辑

- **零在制品库存**：每个流程单元（如试卷、汽车）完成后立即传递至下一工站，消除等待和搬运浪费。  
- **小运输批次**：类比「每日购买1卷卫生纸」，通过高频小批量补货减少库存持有成本，但需供应链高度协同。  

##### 3.2 实施前提

- **流程灵活性**：设备需支持快速换型（如数字化控制生产线）。  
- **供应商整合**：要求供应商就近建厂或采用协同物流（如汽车部件同步配送）。  
- **文化变革**：员工需适应持续流动的工作模式，而非传统批量任务。  

#### 4. 关键工具与行动指南

1. **看板系统设计**：  
   - 确定容器大小（如单个零件容器）、补货信号触发机制（如电子看板）。  
   - 限制在制品数量，暴露瓶颈并持续改进（如通过减少容器数量倒逼效率提升）。  

2. **均衡化排产步骤**：  
   - **需求分析**：拆分产品类型及比例（如轿车50%、旅行车50%）。  
   - **排程算法**：按比例交替投料（如ABAB序列），平滑资源负载。  

3. **单件流落地策略**：  
   - **价值流映射（VSM）**：识别非增值环节（如运输、等待），重构为连续流。  
   - **标准化作业**：制定单件流操作手册，培训员工适应新节奏。  

---

#### 结论

实现流程顺畅需系统性融合**拉动机制**、**均衡化排产**和**单件流**，其本质是通过**减少变异**和**增强柔性**对抗传统批量思维的惯性。正如视频所述：「流程优化不是局部决策，而是重构供应链、设备与文化的全局变革。」企业需以「乌龟哲学」构建稳定、可持续的精益系统，而非追求短期效率冲刺。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

#### 视频小节5: Achieving a Smooth Process Flow

字幕文本: 

One of the privileges of being a warden professor, is that I get to work with some really smart doctoral students. My students are my collaborators in research and more often than not, they are also my teaching assistants in my class. At this point, I should confess it is really my teaching assistants who grade the final exam. Now, the exam consists out of a dozen or so question, each of which has two, three, four sub questions. So let's look at how the TAs organize the grading process. Here's a picture of two of my favorite doctoral students. Leslie Meng, now on the faculty at Yale, and Dawson Kawa, now on the faculty of Georgetown. Leslie and Dawson were grading exams on this day, about 120 of them. Now surprisingly, they had to split up the work between the two of them, and you see how each of them is grading about 60 exams. What do you notice when looking at this picture? First, we see that Dawson has 60 exams in front of him. All of them are turned on a particular page. Leslie, in contrast, has only one exam in front of her and she has one stack of exams to her left and one stack to her right. Can you imagine what they do differently? Well, let's start with Leslie. Leslie picks up an exam, goes through the exam from beginning to end, and then enters the exam score into a table, one exam after the other until all of them are fully graded. Makes sense, doesn't it? Look at Dawson, Dawson starts with question 1. Say question 1 has three sub questions, and then Dawson grades question 1 for all the exams. Then he moves to question 2 and repeats the whole thing. Ask yourself for a moment, what are the pros and cons of the two strategies? Now, since few of you will be entering the exam grading business, I want to generalize this example and talk about how flow units journey through a process. What we have done so far in this course, we have simply assumed that a flow unit makes its way through the process whenever there's resources downstream that has capacity. But how that flow unit is managed and what triggers that flow unit to advance is actually pretty important. In this video, I want to talk about three ways we can manage flow. We first talk about push versus pull, including just in time deliveries. We then talk about mixed model production, and finally we will talk about single unit flows as opposed to transport batches. Imagine you have a three step process with the capacity levels that you see here. You have enough input for that process and you have hardworking and motivated employees. What's going to happen? Well, it's clear that station 2 here is the bottleneck, but since station one is motivated and works really hard, he or she is going to push units into the process. All of them are going to pile up in front of station 2. This really doesn't help the flow rate because the capacity constraint is at station 2, but it will increase the inventory. In a setting like this, what we really want is station 1 to slow down. We prefer station 1 to be idle for half of the time as opposed to just flooding the process by pushing in more inventory. Now, you might say that we could send the worker at station home after we've completed a pile of inventory at station 1 in the first half of the day. There's certainly some truth to that, but the problem is it's certainly not lean, because now we have a pile of inventory between stations 1 and 2. Instead, what we should do is we should pace the process based on the speed of the bottleneck. Even better, we should think about how we can pace this process based on the speed of demand. Remember the concept of tactime? We should operate at the tact of demand. Now ideally, we would also balance the line so that big differences in capacity levels would not occur in the first place. But you will just never get a perfect line balance. So what can we do to avoid undesirable inventory buildup? We have to really pull the work through the process from the downstream, as opposed to pushing the work in from the upstream. Now, one way of achieving such a pull system is known as a Kanban system. Imagine you're selling these lovely black boxes here to the market. For sake of argument, say the downstream here is the last resource in the process. Once you've depleted a certain amount of inventory of the boxes at the last resource, typically one container, you need to inform the upstream that you need more. Connected to that container is a Kanban card. Once that container is empty, that Kanban card is going to be handed over to the station, the resource upstream that is feeding you, your internal supplier. Now, that person or that resource feeding you should sit there idle and do nothing until they have received the Kanban card. That's why a Kanban cut is oftentimes referred to as a work authorization form. Now again, it sounds really stupid because you're forcing people to be idle. But in the lean world, it's better to be idle rather than having to run ahead and push inventory into the system. So through the Kanban cards, you really control how much inventory is in the system. You authorize the amount of inventory. Now, the extreme version of that approach to pulling work is you have a Kanban card for every single flow unit. That means a container size is really equal to one, and every unit is now replenished one by one. Consider, for example, the replenishment of complex modules such as seeds or dashboards or exhaust systems in an automotive plant. It's fascinating to see how when the vehicle enters a certain point in the production, say the paint shop. There's an electronic signal that is sent to the supplier requesting the modules for the final assembly. And then the supplier has something like three or four hours to basically go through their operation of making the module, putting it on a truck and delivering it to the final assembly line. And then magically, just when your vehicle that is in need of the seat is at station 255 seat assembly, that seat pops up just in time. So this is real just in time, often referred to as synchronized production. Next, let's talk about the idea of mixed model production. Remember Dawson, the TA? Why did he like to grade all the exams on question 1 before grading all the exam on question 2? The reason for that is what in operations we call a setup time or a switching time. If you've watched my module on product variety in multiple flow units, you might remember the idea of setups and that they require capacity. Imagine an automotive plant that is producing two types of cars, a wagon and a sedan. Since the body panels of a wagon are different from the body panels of a sedan, some of the stamping machines need to be retooled as you switch over. The operators have to do something that is called a changeover. Think about making cookies, for example. You're baking cookies and you're switching over between making cookies in the shape of a star and sometimes you make cookies in the shape of a heart. The problem, of course, is that changing over a stamping machine that is as big as my house and a stamping dice which weigh multiple tons of steel, well, that is much harder than switching over from a star cookie cutter to a hard cookie cutter. So setups and changeovers create a form of scale economies which is really a form of specialization. This is by no means unique to an autoplant as we saw again with my TA example. You might also think about a surgeon who might find it easier to do six meniscal surgeries in a row as opposed to doing a knee surgery, then a hip surgery and then doing an ankle surgery. People like specialization, people like scale economies. Anyway, back to my auto example. Given that retooling is hard and will really eat up my production capacity, the plant manager doesn't want to switch forth and back between sedan and wagons all too often. So he or she does what Dawson did. He or she runs a long production run of sedans. Now suppose the demand for sedans and the demand for wagons is about split evenly 50, 50, what happens? While we're producing sedans, we're not producing wagons. So any sales from wagons has to come from inventory. So wagon inventory is coming down and in content, since we are allocating all our capacity to the sedans, the sedan inventory is going up. Then eventually we will switch from producing sedans to producing wagons, and the opposite occurs. Now, the sedan inventory is coming down, the wagon inventory is going up. You see the resulting oscillation here, the up and down of the inventory cycles, and on average, the inventory is exactly going to be in the middle. Now, contrast that with a plant that is able to change over production with less effort or even without any effort at all, with smaller, ultimately no change over times, what would you do? Exactly, we would produce at the rate of demand. And since we assumed that demand for wagons and sedans would be evenly split, we produce in much smaller batches. And ultimately, if there are no change over time, we will produce in batch sizes of one. The technical term for this is a mixed model production, also known as heijunka. Hajjunka helps us keep inventory low, it also has another nice property. Imagine that your role in the process is to install the trunk opening mechanism, which is specific and unique only for the wagon. That means that when the plant is producing wagons, you're running all out. But then once the plant switches over to sedans, you really have plenty of idle time. So you alternate between all out sprints and leisurely walks. In contrast with mixed model production, your workload is level, right? That employee putting in the trunk opener simply works on every other car. So the moment you do heijunka work starts to be much more level. I know that by now you're probably sick and tired of my quotes, but here's one last one, run like the tortoise, not the hare. This advice is really based on the ancient fable describing the race between a hare and a tortoise. The hare ridicules the slow moving tortoise who challenges the hare to a race. And in the race, the hare quickly gains a significant lead, and hence the hare feels comfortable taking a little nap, even if it's in the middle of the race. The tortoise though, tired as it is, keeps on going at a steady and even pace. When the hare eventually wakes up, the hare is so far behind that all the hair does is see how the tortoise springs into victory. Unless you control your processes, processes have the tendency to operate like the hare. Your resources are motivated, and so whatever they do, everything gets pushed into the process as quickly as possible. This is especially true in service processes, where it's the customers who push themselves forward. But you have to run an operation at an even and steady pace. Run like the tortoise, not the hare. That gets me to my third concept I wanted to talk about in this video here, and that is the idea of single unit flows. Because of these changeover times, we have a reason to create a production batch or production run consisting out of multiple floor units. Now, similarly, if we have a significant transportation time between stations, we have an incentive to wait for units to pile up before we do the next transportation trip. Just think about how you're buying stuff like toilet paper. Even short of the COVID-19 toilet paper craziness, chances are that you don't buy toilet paper every day. Despite the fact that you're probably using toilet paper every day. You might purchase ten rolls at your local supermarket, you might purchase 100 rolls at Costco. Now, buying 100 rolls of Costco toilet paper is likely to be cheaper and more convenient. But if you do this, on average, you now have 50 rolls of toilet paper in the house. The Toyota mindset is that if I consume one roll of toilet paper in my house every day, I should be purchasing one roll of toilet paper every day. If everybody would have followed that strategy, the March 2020 craziness around supermarket shelves being emptied of toilet paper would certainly not have happened. The idea of changing over from one motor to the other every minute or two, and the idea of replenishing your toilet paper one roll at a time, sounds appealing from an inventory perspective. But wouldn't that translate it into lots of wasted production capacity and many trips to the supermarket? Yes, that's the problem. This gets me to my last insight in this video, the key to implement a lean operation is not just to change your production plans or your replenishment cycles. Instead, you have to build processes that are flexible enough to support this. You have to invest in flexible production equipment, you need to train your workforce and you need to involve your suppliers, potentially asking them to build a plant next to yours. This is why, in the introduction module I made inflexibility one of my free system inhibitors. All this requires a much bigger transformation than you alone deciding that you from tomorrow onwards, are going to run a lean operation. In the next video, we'll talk about such a bigger transformation looks like. I'll see you then.
