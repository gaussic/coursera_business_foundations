### 核心概念与工具  
1. **推式（Push） vs. 拉式（Pull）系统**  
   • **推式系统**：上游资源按自身节奏生产，导致库存堆积（如助教Dawson批量批改同一题目，试卷堆积）；  
   • **拉式系统**：下游需求触发上游生产，通过**Kanban看板**控制库存（如汽车座椅按需同步供应）。  
   • **Kanban机制**：  
     ◦ **容器与看板**：每个容器对应一个看板，空容器触发上游补货；  
     ◦ **零库存目标**：极端情况下单件流（如丰田JIT生产）。  

2. **混合模式生产（Heijunka）**  
   • **定义**：根据需求动态调整生产组合（如交替生产轿车与旅行车），避免长批次生产导致的库存波动。  
   • **优势**：  
     ◦ **均衡负荷**：避免资源在“冲刺-闲置”间切换（如外科医生专注单一手术类型）；  
     ◦ **降低库存**：减少因需求波动导致的库存积压。  

3. **单件流（Single Unit Flow）**  
   • **理念**：消除批次生产与运输，追求“一个流”（如每日采购单卷卫生纸 vs. 批量囤货）；  
   • **挑战**：需柔性生产设备与供应链协同（如供应商就近建厂）。

### 行业应用与案例分析  
4. **教育场景（试卷批改）**  
   • **推式问题**：Dawson批量批改同一题目，导致试卷堆积、资源闲置；  
   • **拉式优化**：Leslie逐份批改，减少半成品库存，但需牺牲切换效率。  

5. **汽车制造（库存管理）**  
   • **传统生产**：长批次生产导致库存波动（如轿车库存积压时旅行车缺货）；  
   • **混合模式**：交替生产轿车与旅行车，库存稳定在中间水平（Heijunka）。  

6. **消费场景（卫生纸采购）**  
   • **批量采购**：低成本但高库存（50卷平均库存）；  
   • **单件流理想**：按需采购（零库存），但需高频运输支持。

### 关键结论与行动建议  
1. **流程节奏控制**：  
   • **龟兔赛跑启示**：以稳定节奏（Takt Time）运营，避免资源过载或闲置（如汽车厂均衡生产）。  

2. **拉式系统设计**：  
   • **Kanban实践**：通过看板授权生产，避免上游过度推送（如汽车座椅按需同步供应）；  
   • **需求驱动**：同步生产与销售节奏（如按日补货而非月度计划）。  

3. **混合生产与柔性能力**：  
   • **减少切换时间**：投资柔性设备（如快速换模技术）；  
   • **供应商协同**：构建响应式供应链（如供应商临近布局）。  

4. **文化变革与技术投资**：  
   • **员工培训**：培养多技能员工以支持混合生产；  
   • **数字化工具**：通过物联网与AI实现实时需求感知与生产调度。  

**最终目标**：通过**拉式系统**、**混合模式生产**与**单件流设计**，构建**低库存（减少资金占用）、高响应（需求匹配）、柔性化（适应变化）**的精益运营体系，实现流程效率与客户价值的双重提升。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

One of the privileges of being a warden professor, is that I get to work with some really smart doctoral students. My students are my collaborators in research and more often than not, they are also my teaching assistants in my class. At this point, I should confess it is really my teaching assistants who grade the final exam. Now, the exam consists out of a dozen or so question, each of which has two, three, four sub questions. So let's look at how the TAs organize the grading process. Here's a picture of two of my favorite doctoral students. Leslie Meng, now on the faculty at Yale, and Dawson Kawa, now on the faculty of Georgetown. Leslie and Dawson were grading exams on this day, about 120 of them. Now surprisingly, they had to split up the work between the two of them, and you see how each of them is grading about 60 exams. What do you notice when looking at this picture? First, we see that Dawson has 60 exams in front of him. All of them are turned on a particular page. Leslie, in contrast, has only one exam in front of her and she has one stack of exams to her left and one stack to her right. Can you imagine what they do differently? Well, let's start with Leslie. Leslie picks up an exam, goes through the exam from beginning to end, and then enters the exam score into a table, one exam after the other until all of them are fully graded. Makes sense, doesn't it? Look at Dawson, Dawson starts with question 1. Say question 1 has three sub questions, and then Dawson grades question 1 for all the exams. Then he moves to question 2 and repeats the whole thing. Ask yourself for a moment, what are the pros and cons of the two strategies? Now, since few of you will be entering the exam grading business, I want to generalize this example and talk about how flow units journey through a process. What we have done so far in this course, we have simply assumed that a flow unit makes its way through the process whenever there's resources downstream that has capacity. But how that flow unit is managed and what triggers that flow unit to advance is actually pretty important. In this video, I want to talk about three ways we can manage flow. We first talk about push versus pull, including just in time deliveries. We then talk about mixed model production, and finally we will talk about single unit flows as opposed to transport batches. Imagine you have a three step process with the capacity levels that you see here. You have enough input for that process and you have hardworking and motivated employees. What's going to happen? Well, it's clear that station 2 here is the bottleneck, but since station one is motivated and works really hard, he or she is going to push units into the process. All of them are going to pile up in front of station 2. This really doesn't help the flow rate because the capacity constraint is at station 2, but it will increase the inventory. In a setting like this, what we really want is station 1 to slow down. We prefer station 1 to be idle for half of the time as opposed to just flooding the process by pushing in more inventory. Now, you might say that we could send the worker at station home after we've completed a pile of inventory at station 1 in the first half of the day. There's certainly some truth to that, but the problem is it's certainly not lean, because now we have a pile of inventory between stations 1 and 2. Instead, what we should do is we should pace the process based on the speed of the bottleneck. Even better, we should think about how we can pace this process based on the speed of demand. Remember the concept of tactime? We should operate at the tact of demand. Now ideally, we would also balance the line so that big differences in capacity levels would not occur in the first place. But you will just never get a perfect line balance. So what can we do to avoid undesirable inventory buildup? We have to really pull the work through the process from the downstream, as opposed to pushing the work in from the upstream. Now, one way of achieving such a pull system is known as a Kanban system. Imagine you're selling these lovely black boxes here to the market. For sake of argument, say the downstream here is the last resource in the process. Once you've depleted a certain amount of inventory of the boxes at the last resource, typically one container, you need to inform the upstream that you need more. Connected to that container is a Kanban card. Once that container is empty, that Kanban card is going to be handed over to the station, the resource upstream that is feeding you, your internal supplier. Now, that person or that resource feeding you should sit there idle and do nothing until they have received the Kanban card. That's why a Kanban cut is oftentimes referred to as a work authorization form. Now again, it sounds really stupid because you're forcing people to be idle. But in the lean world, it's better to be idle rather than having to run ahead and push inventory into the system. So through the Kanban cards, you really control how much inventory is in the system. You authorize the amount of inventory. Now, the extreme version of that approach to pulling work is you have a Kanban card for every single flow unit. That means a container size is really equal to one, and every unit is now replenished one by one. Consider, for example, the replenishment of complex modules such as seeds or dashboards or exhaust systems in an automotive plant. It's fascinating to see how when the vehicle enters a certain point in the production, say the paint shop. There's an electronic signal that is sent to the supplier requesting the modules for the final assembly. And then the supplier has something like three or four hours to basically go through their operation of making the module, putting it on a truck and delivering it to the final assembly line. And then magically, just when your vehicle that is in need of the seat is at station 255 seat assembly, that seat pops up just in time. So this is real just in time, often referred to as synchronized production. Next, let's talk about the idea of mixed model production. Remember Dawson, the TA? Why did he like to grade all the exams on question 1 before grading all the exam on question 2? The reason for that is what in operations we call a setup time or a switching time. If you've watched my module on product variety in multiple flow units, you might remember the idea of setups and that they require capacity. Imagine an automotive plant that is producing two types of cars, a wagon and a sedan. Since the body panels of a wagon are different from the body panels of a sedan, some of the stamping machines need to be retooled as you switch over. The operators have to do something that is called a changeover. Think about making cookies, for example. You're baking cookies and you're switching over between making cookies in the shape of a star and sometimes you make cookies in the shape of a heart. The problem, of course, is that changing over a stamping machine that is as big as my house and a stamping dice which weigh multiple tons of steel, well, that is much harder than switching over from a star cookie cutter to a hard cookie cutter. So setups and changeovers create a form of scale economies which is really a form of specialization. This is by no means unique to an autoplant as we saw again with my TA example. You might also think about a surgeon who might find it easier to do six meniscal surgeries in a row as opposed to doing a knee surgery, then a hip surgery and then doing an ankle surgery. People like specialization, people like scale economies. Anyway, back to my auto example. Given that retooling is hard and will really eat up my production capacity, the plant manager doesn't want to switch forth and back between sedan and wagons all too often. So he or she does what Dawson did. He or she runs a long production run of sedans. Now suppose the demand for sedans and the demand for wagons is about split evenly 50, 50, what happens? While we're producing sedans, we're not producing wagons. So any sales from wagons has to come from inventory. So wagon inventory is coming down and in content, since we are allocating all our capacity to the sedans, the sedan inventory is going up. Then eventually we will switch from producing sedans to producing wagons, and the opposite occurs. Now, the sedan inventory is coming down, the wagon inventory is going up. You see the resulting oscillation here, the up and down of the inventory cycles, and on average, the inventory is exactly going to be in the middle. Now, contrast that with a plant that is able to change over production with less effort or even without any effort at all, with smaller, ultimately no change over times, what would you do? Exactly, we would produce at the rate of demand. And since we assumed that demand for wagons and sedans would be evenly split, we produce in much smaller batches. And ultimately, if there are no change over time, we will produce in batch sizes of one. The technical term for this is a mixed model production, also known as heijunka. Hajjunka helps us keep inventory low, it also has another nice property. Imagine that your role in the process is to install the trunk opening mechanism, which is specific and unique only for the wagon. That means that when the plant is producing wagons, you're running all out. But then once the plant switches over to sedans, you really have plenty of idle time. So you alternate between all out sprints and leisurely walks. In contrast with mixed model production, your workload is level, right? That employee putting in the trunk opener simply works on every other car. So the moment you do heijunka work starts to be much more level. I know that by now you're probably sick and tired of my quotes, but here's one last one, run like the tortoise, not the hare. This advice is really based on the ancient fable describing the race between a hare and a tortoise. The hare ridicules the slow moving tortoise who challenges the hare to a race. And in the race, the hare quickly gains a significant lead, and hence the hare feels comfortable taking a little nap, even if it's in the middle of the race. The tortoise though, tired as it is, keeps on going at a steady and even pace. When the hare eventually wakes up, the hare is so far behind that all the hair does is see how the tortoise springs into victory. Unless you control your processes, processes have the tendency to operate like the hare. Your resources are motivated, and so whatever they do, everything gets pushed into the process as quickly as possible. This is especially true in service processes, where it's the customers who push themselves forward. But you have to run an operation at an even and steady pace. Run like the tortoise, not the hare. That gets me to my third concept I wanted to talk about in this video here, and that is the idea of single unit flows. Because of these changeover times, we have a reason to create a production batch or production run consisting out of multiple floor units. Now, similarly, if we have a significant transportation time between stations, we have an incentive to wait for units to pile up before we do the next transportation trip. Just think about how you're buying stuff like toilet paper. Even short of the COVID-19 toilet paper craziness, chances are that you don't buy toilet paper every day. Despite the fact that you're probably using toilet paper every day. You might purchase ten rolls at your local supermarket, you might purchase 100 rolls at Costco. Now, buying 100 rolls of Costco toilet paper is likely to be cheaper and more convenient. But if you do this, on average, you now have 50 rolls of toilet paper in the house. The Toyota mindset is that if I consume one roll of toilet paper in my house every day, I should be purchasing one roll of toilet paper every day. If everybody would have followed that strategy, the March 2020 craziness around supermarket shelves being emptied of toilet paper would certainly not have happened. The idea of changing over from one motor to the other every minute or two, and the idea of replenishing your toilet paper one roll at a time, sounds appealing from an inventory perspective. But wouldn't that translate it into lots of wasted production capacity and many trips to the supermarket? Yes, that's the problem. This gets me to my last insight in this video, the key to implement a lean operation is not just to change your production plans or your replenishment cycles. Instead, you have to build processes that are flexible enough to support this. You have to invest in flexible production equipment, you need to train your workforce and you need to involve your suppliers, potentially asking them to build a plant next to yours. This is why, in the introduction module I made inflexibility one of my free system inhibitors. All this requires a much bigger transformation than you alone deciding that you from tomorrow onwards, are going to run a lean operation. In the next video, we'll talk about such a bigger transformation looks like. I'll see you then.
