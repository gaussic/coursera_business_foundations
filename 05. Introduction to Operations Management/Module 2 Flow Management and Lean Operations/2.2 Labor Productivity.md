### 核心概念与框架  
1. **劳动力生产率的两个核心指标**  
   • **平均劳动力利用率（Average Labor Utilization）**：  
     ◦ **定义**：实际有效工作时间占总可用工作时间的比例，反映劳动力资源的使用效率。  
     ◦ **计算公式**：  
       \[
       \text{劳动力利用率} = \frac{\text{劳动力内容（Labor Content）}}{\text{劳动力内容 + 空闲时间（Idle Time）}}
       \]  
     ◦ **案例（Subway）**：劳动力内容=120秒/三明治（37+46+37），空闲时间=18秒（员工1和3各9秒），利用率为 \( \frac{120}{120+18} \approx 86.9\% \)。  

   • **直接劳动力成本（Direct Labor Cost）**：  
     ◦ **定义**：单位产品所消耗的劳动力成本。  
     ◦ **计算公式**：  
       \[
       \text{直接劳动力成本} = \frac{\text{总工资}}{\text{流程速率（Flow Rate）}}
       \]  
     ◦ **案例（Subway）**：3名员工时薪$12/小时，流程速率78三明治/小时 → 直接劳动力成本= \( \frac{3 \times 12}{78} \approx 0.46美元/三明治 \)。  

2. **空闲时间（Idle Time）与平衡性（Balance）**  
   • **空闲时间**：资源未被利用的时间，由瓶颈环节决定（非瓶颈资源的处理时间短于周期时间）。  
     ◦ **案例（Subway）**：员工1和3的空闲时间=46秒（周期时间）-37秒（处理时间）=9秒/单位。  
   • **平衡性优化**：通过调整任务分配或处理时间，减少空闲时间，提升劳动力利用率（如Subway将员工2的处理时间从46秒降至43秒）。  

---

### 工具应用与案例分析  
3. **Subway三明治制作流程的改进与利润影响**  
   • **原始数据**：  
     ◦ 周期时间=46秒/单位，流程速率=78单位/小时，直接劳动力成本=0.46美元/单位。  
     ◦ 收入=78单位×6美元=468美元/小时，成本（食材+人工+固定）=78×2 + 36 + 250=412美元/小时 → 利润=56美元/小时。  
   • **优化后（员工2处理时间缩短3秒）**：  
     ◦ 新周期时间=43秒/单位，流程速率提升至≈83单位/小时，利润增至≈83×(6-2) -36 -250= **86美元/小时**，增长53.6%。  

4. **供应链视角下的劳动力成本（汽车行业案例）**  
   • **表面数据**：汽车制造商（如戴姆勒）的直接劳动力成本仅占约5%，但供应链中各级供应商的劳动力成本累积占比显著（如一级供应商占70%）。  
   • **启示**：  
     ◦ 优化供应链的劳动力效率（如供应商流程改进）可大幅降低总成本。  
     ◦ 碳足迹管理同样需关注供应链上游（如原材料生产、物流环节）。  

---

### 关键结论  
1. **劳动力利用率与成本的关系**：  
   • 高利用率反映资源平衡性良好，但单纯追求利用率可能掩盖效率问题（如员工故意放慢速度以消除空闲时间）。  
   • **平衡优化**：需结合流程速率与周期时间，避免局部优化导致整体效率下降。  

2. **瓶颈对利润的杠杆效应**：  
   • 瓶颈环节的微小改进（如缩短3秒处理时间）可通过提升流程速率显著增加收入，利润增幅远超成本节约本身。  
   • **案例启示**：Subway优化后利润增长53.6%，证明产能约束下瓶颈优化的优先级。  

3. **全局视角下的劳动力成本**：  
   • 企业需关注供应链全链条的劳动力效率，而非仅自身直接成本。  
   • **数据驱动**：通过分解供应商成本结构，识别隐藏的劳动力浪费（如重复工序、低效排班）。  

4. **劳动力生产率的财务价值**：  
   • **收入驱动**：提升流程速率可直接增加收入（如Subway每小时多售5个三明治，收入+30美元）。  
   • **成本控制**：降低直接劳动力成本（如自动化）或间接成本（如减少供应链层级）均可提升利润率。  

**最终目标**：通过**微观流程优化**（减少空闲时间、平衡资源）与**供应链协同**，实现**高效率（高利用率）、低成本（低单位劳动力成本）、高利润（产能释放）**的精益运营。

## 模块标题: Week 2: Flow Management and Lean Operations

引言: 

In operations management, flow focuses on the movement of materials, products, and information through the various stages of a production or service process. Lean operations focus on identifying sources of waste both in terms of resources and processes. Optimizing flow can improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By learning to carefully observe how work is done, we can become better at identifying waste. The goal is to create efficient and effective processes that maximize output while minimizing waste.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine cycle time of a process and the idle time of resource
- Find the labor content and the average labor utilization
- Determine the costs of direct labor
- Compute takt time and target manpower
- Using OEE, measure the waste of capacity at a resource
- Using %-VAT, measure the waste of flow time of a flow unit
- Identify ways to control the amount of inventory in a process

#### 视频小节2: Labor Productivity

字幕文本: 

Today I want to talk about labor productivity. I will introduce two measures of labor productivity: the average labor utilization and the cost of direct labor. I then want to spend some time with you reflecting upon the financial importance of labor productivity. Let's go back to the Excel model that we had started in the last video. We have the three resources here. Remember, we had the processing times, the capacity, all the way down to the cycle time. Now imagine you and I would run the Subway restaurant where the owners repaid the workers. What would make us really angry? Exactly? We have a worker that sits or stands there and it's not working. We say the person is idle. How much idle time do we observe in this picture here right now? Again, as for the moment, assume that we have unlimited demand or really big number of customers asking for sandwiches. Where you're going to go see the idle time? Who was sent around doing nothing? Well, worker number 2, the bottleneck is never idle. In contrast, the other two workers have some slack relative to the longer processing time of worker number 2. That number is simply the cycle time minus the processing time of that station. The first person has an idle time of nine seconds. Again, the bottleneck will not have any idle time, and the third one has again nine seconds of an idle time. The total idle time we get by summing up all the times for the individual stations, and when added, that gives us a grand total of 18 seconds. Those 18 seconds are large number or is it a small number? That's really hard to interpret. In absolute terms, it's really hard to judge. We need to take this number relative to something else. Let me introduce another measure. I will refer to this number as a labor content. The labor content is simply the sum of all the processing times that involve labor. In our case here, we get the labor content of 120 seconds per sandwich. These aging seconds of idle time should be compared to the 120 seconds of making a sandwich. In contrast, in an auto plant, 18 seconds of total idle time relative to maybe 10,000 seconds of labor content for a car what we file as significant. This is the intuition behind of what I have now will redefine as the labor utilization. Labor utilization looks at the labor content. For every sandwich, I'm going to get 120 seconds of labor, but I need to pay the workers for the 120 seconds at their work plus the aging seconds they are idle. That ratio is called, again, the labor utilization. Don't worry for now about the details. We're going to go and review all the definitions later on in this video. The labor utilization works at labor content relative to the idle time. I can write this slightly differently. Again, I will summarize this on a PowerPoint slide later on. For now, I look at the labor content, and rather than dividing it by the labor content plus the idle time, I can divide it by three times the cycle time. It shouldn't surprise us. This gets us the same utilization from a moment ago. Now let me emphasize what labor utilization measures. Labor utilization measures balance. Balance is good, but that's not the only thing that matters. Just as a thought experiment. Imagine I have three very lazy but really smart employees. What are they going to do? They tell each other, look, Christian is a kind of stupid manager. He's going to look at the labor utilization to judge our performance. Why don't we all slow down and everybody has a processing time of 60 seconds? What happens to the labor utilization with this evil plan? If all the workers have a processing time of 60 seconds, there will be no idle time. The process is perfectly balanced and the labor utilization goes to 100%. Has this process become more efficient? Clearly not. We need another measure here for labor productivity. Let me propose another measure which I'll refer to as cost of direct labor. What's the cost of direct labor? What we're doing with this measure is we look at the wages per unit of time. Let's assume for now we have three people here and we pay each of them 12 bucks per hour. Over that hour, we've created ourselves a flow rate of what we said was 78 sandwiches. The cost per sandwich in terms of direct labor is $0.46. Think about this the next time you're going to a subway restaurant, you typically tend to pay around five to six bucks for foot-long sandwich. In there, there are about $0.46 of labor. Just as before, we have the three resources, the processing time so it's 37, 46 and 37. Those are the workers 1, 2 and 3 and we found that the cycle time is driven by the second resource, 46 seconds per sandwich. That means the other two resources, 1 and 3 have some slack relative to the cycle time, and then slack is going to be their idle time. So they're 46 -37, which is 9 seconds of idle time each and we're going to get a grand total of 18 seconds of idle time. But how do we interpret that number? Is it big, is it small? We have to take it relative to something and that something we said is going to be the labor content. Labor content. This is some of the processing times, 37+46+37=120. When we're going to judge whether the 18 seconds are large or small, we're going to take them relative to those 120 seconds. That gives us the labor utilization. One way of computing labor utilization is taking the labor content of 120 seconds. It is really the green here in my 3 bars, 120 seconds, I take it relative to the total, which is a green plus a red, that measures balance and we found that number to be 86.9 percent, so that's one way of computing the normal. There's another way you can do this for reasons I don't want to tell you right now. I will prefer you use this other way. That is by involving the cycle time. You see the definition here to the left. With this definition, you're going to go and look at, again the labor content to 120 seconds and you're dividing it now by three times the cycle time. As you see just as before we get 120/138 and surprise, we get the same 86.9 percent, so that's the average labor utilization as a measure of balance. Finally, we've talked about the cost of direct labor. For that you just look at the wages per unit of time, three workers for $12 per hour, divided by the flow rate, which we found to be 78 point something, which is expressed in sandwiches per hour. The per hour cancels out and we're left with the $0.46 per unit. That gives us a cost of direct labor. Before we talk more about labor productivity, let me address a question that I oftentimes get asked. Does labor productivity really matter? So here's some cost data from the auto industry compiled by gentlemen Dan Whitney at MIT. What Dan looked at is the total cost for an OEM in the auto industry. In this case, the data was from Daimler. The total cost you can basically find in the profit and loss statement and the accounting of Daimler and from the total cost for Daimler, you notice that the vast majority of cost sit in purchasing, what 70 percent of the total cost is going to be in purchasing and only a relatively small piece of the total cost is going to be labor costs. Most of the cost of that is coming through our purchasing department. Daimler pays relatively little money in labor. Why care about labor productivity? I would agree that this view is a little bit misleading because keep in mind, that the 70 percent of costs that Daimler spend from those 70 percent, those are the total costs that go to their suppliers and these suppliers, in turn, also incur labor cost. If you factor in the labor that the suppliers like Bosch or Continental spend. In fact, those in as well, the total percentage of costs making a vehicle is getting much larger. They're not on timeless book, but they are real costs. Now, the suppliers are going to have their suppliers. We call those second tier suppliers and those have suppliers of their own. If we roll this up, also, the value chain, you do see that there are a fair bit of cost sitting around in labor. The raw material costs are much smaller than you'd think. That has a couple of important implications. First and foremost, pennies manner in a product, but oftentimes these pennies will not be on your book. You really have to go out and work through the supply chain and find these costs somewhere upstream. By the way, the same is true for improving your carbon footprint. With globalization and global trade, suppliers carry more and more responsibility as tapping into their cost base is central. Even if this is not visible in the P&L statement of the manufacturing company, those costs matter. Let's go back to our subway example one last time, this time with an eye on profit. Profit is simply revenue minus cost. So let's start understanding what the revenues here look like. Revenue is simply the number of sandwiches that we were making per hour, flow rate, times the average price per sandwich. Let's just assume we're selling these sandwiches for six dollars per unit. Say it takes us two dollars in food costs to make a sandwich. The first item here that we have on the cost is we're spending the same 78 units per hour times two dollars per item in material cost. We also have labor costs. We agreed on the labor costs. We assume that we are paying these workers $12 per hour for all three workers. We also have some other forms of fixed costs. Fixed costs are a whole topic in itself. We could talk about cost allocation and what drives these costs for long sessions by itself, whether it's rent, insurance, marketing, the overhead and what have you. Let's just say for now with some plausible cost allocation, we have $250 of fixed costs per hour. Remember, most of the business will be over the lunch hour and that is why I allocate so much of the fixed costs to that one hour. This allows us now to compute the profit. We have the revenue minus the food cost, minus labor costs, minus fixed costs, which gets us a profit of about $27 per hour. So I'm making about 27 bucks per hour. I don't want to comment whether that is a lot or a little. For now, let's do something else. Let's think about some improvement strategies, which is something that we'll talk about in the next video. Let's just, for the sake of argument, imagine we could shave off some seconds of the bottleneck. This could either be done by automating or by having a more skilled worker or by taking some of the 46 seconds and move them to the left and to the right. Again, more on how to find these improvements in the next videos. For now, assume this number would go down to 43 seconds. What's going to happen to profit? Clearly, profit is going to go up. The question is by how much. Let's take a look. We have $27 in the baseline scenario. Three seconds faster at the bottleneck corresponds to an improvement of about 7% of the processing time at the bottleneck and about 2-3% in labor content. Three seconds faster at the bottleneck is translating into a profit increase from $27 per hour to $48 per hour. We almost doubled our profitability. Wow, almost doubling profits just because of shaving off a couple of three seconds at the bottleneck. That is a key insight here into the value of improving productivity. It's not just about cutting the cost of labor. Poor productivity creates a real opportunity cost of not selling more sandwiches. More productivity helps us to increase the top line and serve more customers. In today's video, we saw that labor productivity is important for two reasons. First, little things set up. The example from the auto industry has reminded us it's not just about the labor that happens in our process. Our suppliers use labor to generate our inputs. Our supplier has its own suppliers who also use labor. When you add up the labor costs to the value chain, the cost numbers become quite sizable. Second, we learned how labor can act as a constraint on the process. That gets us back to the bottleneck. The reason why we want to shave off a second or two at the bottleneck is not to save ourselves the associated labor costs. Rather, we want to do this with the aim of generating some additional capacity. If you're capacity-constraint, more bottleneck capacity is worth a ton of money as it adds to top-line revenues. What is not to like about that? In the coming video, we'll talk more about process improvement strategies. Until then, grab a sandwich and look for the bottleneck.
