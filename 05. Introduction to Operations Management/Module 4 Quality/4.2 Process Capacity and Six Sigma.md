## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块4 - 质量

### 课程4.2 过程能力和六西格玛

以**过程能力分析**和**六西格玛框架**为核心，结合食品制造业的生动案例，系统阐释了质量管理中变异控制的量化方法与工具。

#### 1. 核心概念：规格界限与过程能力

##### 1.1 规格界限（Specification Limits）

- 通过欧盟黄瓜弯曲度标准（10毫米/10厘米）案例，说明质量管理的核心是**明确合格与缺陷的边界**。规格界限（USL/LSL）的设定需平衡生产实际与客户需求，例如M&M巧克力豆的包装重量规格（47-53克）。  
- **关键结论**：规格界限的制定需基于统计学分析，既要避免过度严苛（如欧盟黄瓜标准引发争议），也要防止过松导致客户不满（如M&M重量不足或超重）。

##### 1.2 过程能力指数（Cp）

- 公式：  
     \[
     C_p = \frac{USL - LSL}{6\sigma}
     \]  
     其中σ为过程标准差。Cp值反映**过程变异相对于规格范围的适应性**：  
  - *Cp=1*：3σ控制（缺陷率0.27%）  
  -  *Cp=2*：6σ控制（缺陷率0.00034%）  
- **案例分析**：  
  - M&M巧克力豆产线实测σ=1.03克，Cp≈1（缺陷率可控但仍有改进空间）；  
  - 滑板车零件生产（规格范围0.1毫米）通过Cp分析发现与M&M产线能力相当，凸显工业化生产的标准化水平。

#### 2. 六西格玛框架与质量管理工具

##### 2.1 六西格玛（Six Sigma）的核心逻辑

- 目标：通过减少过程变异（σ↓）提升Cp值，将缺陷率降至百万分之3.4以下。例如，若M&M产线σ从1.03克降至0.5克，Cp将提升至2（六西格玛水平）。  
- **方法论**：  
  - *DMAIC循环*（定义、测量、分析、改进、控制）；  
  - *统计过程控制（SPC）*：通过控制图实时监控变异。

##### 2.2 过程能力提升的实践路径

- **案例：鸡蛋生产优化**  
  - 初始条件：平均重量47克，σ=3克，规格范围44-50克 → Cp=0.33（缺陷率31.7%）；  
  - 目标Cp=0.67 → 需将σ降至1.5克（通过设备校准或原料筛选）。  
- **关键结论**：质量改进需结合**工程控制**（如设备精度提升）与**统计工具**（如过程能力分析），而非依赖经验判断。

#### 3. 质量管理的应用场景与价值

##### 3.1 工业制造场景

- *M&M产线*：高度自动化带来低变异（σ=1.03克），但花生M&M因原料天然变异需更宽松规格；  
- *滑板车零件*：精密制造中微小规格范围（0.1毫米）需六西格玛级控制，否则导致功能失效。

##### 3.2 服务与跨行业延伸

- **医疗行业**：仿照M&M重量控制逻辑，可设计药品剂量包装的统计监控系统；  
- **物流行业**：通过Cp值分析运输时效波动，优化供应链可靠性。

#### 4. 核心启示与行动指南

1. **从数据到决策**：  
   1. 质量管理者需掌握**正态分布假设检验**与**过程能力计算**，例如通过Minitab等工具快速生成能力报告。  
2. **平衡成本与质量**：  
   1. 六西格玛并非适用于所有场景（如农产品可接受更高变异），需根据行业特性选择合理质量目标。  
3. **文化塑造**：  
   1. 通过**全员质量培训**（如SPC工具普及）和**实时反馈机制**（如控制图看板），将质量管理融入组织DNA。

## 模块标题: Week 4: Quality

引言: 

Variability can introduce defects and hinder the pursuit of excellence. By recognizing and managing variability, organizations can lay the foundation for consistent and exceptional quality standards. This module introduces frameworks that provide systematic ways to analyze variability. We’ll look at how statistical analysis and problem-solving methodologies can enhance quality. We’ll also explore the power of real-time information and how it fosters continuous improvement. We’ll examine strategies for finding the root cause of an issue and explore how we might develop targeted solutions as we unravel complex problems.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine by how much the variation in the process needs to be reduced to meet a target defect rate (or capability score)
- Find the defect probabilities
- Determine the capability score of a process
- Explain the six sigma framework and the types of variation

### 第二章: Using Frameworks to Improve Quality/Tools for Your Operations Management Toolbox

#### 视频小节2: Process Capacity and Six Sigma

字幕文本: 

I don't like to talk about politics in my class, but today I will make an exception. European Union Commission regulation Number 1677-88 states that cucumbers are allowed a bend of 10 millimeters per 10 centimeters of length. Cucumbers that bend more than this, do not qualify as Class I or extra class cucumbers. Class two cucumbers are allowed to bend twice as much. If you were a cynic, you might say that resolutions like this were the reason why our British friends left the EU. But allow me to backpedal just a little bit. First, to my knowledge, the EU has since changed this resolution. Second, and maybe more importantly, the resolution speaks to a fundamental problem in quality management. If you want to sort flow units into good units and defective units, you have to define what is good and what is bad. The decision is based on what we call a specification. The commission acknowledges that cucumbers come in different shapes and sizes reflecting the variation inherent in any process, certainly one involving mother nature. Now, according to the EU bureaucrats, there exists an ideal cucumber shape in the form of a straight line, then they view the more cucumber bands are less desirable it is. But how much bend is tolerable? Where's the cutoff? As you wrestle with these types of quality management questions, you'll realize that as absurd this rule might be, it's actually pretty smart. You have a specification and you measured the output against the specification. Now after measuring the curvature of cucumbers for a couple of years, I needed a somewhat sweeter research topic. I got interested in the production process for M&M's. On the labels of M&M bags, it says that there are 47.9 grams of chocolate in there. I have a couple of questions for you. Ask yourself, how much do you think a bag of M&Ms actually weighs? Moreover, what is the standard deviation of that weight? If I would take 1,000 bags, how many of them would be below 47 grams and about 53 grams? Then the last question I have for you, can you think of a product from M&M that has a relatively high degree of variation in weight? Now, arguably these are critical questions that deserve careful academic analysis. Put me on pause and think about the questions. Let's look at the last question first. Which M&M product has the most variation? Did you get that one right? It's the M&M's peanuts. Why is it? Well, peanuts are grown maybe not organically, but they are biologically produced. There's more environmental variation in the production process compared to regular M&Ms. To find the answers to the other three questions here's what I did. I went into the store, bought all the M&M's I could get a hold of. Then I've got my hands on a high-precision scale, and here's what I found. I created myself a sample of 125 bags. In the sample, I found an average weight of 50.0 grams. The standard deviation of the sample was 1.03. I would say from all the things that you can eat or drink, this is a very low standard deviation. Making M&M's, especially those without peanuts, is highly industrialized, and it's probably one of the lowest amount of variation that you can see. Now you'll see a histogram over here, and you see the raw data from the sample in an Excel spreadsheet, ask yourself, would you bet your life on the fact that no bag of M&M's is below 47 or above 53 grams? I looked at the data in my sample, and I don't see a single instance of such outliers in the process. But how unlikely are such outliers? Are they absolutely impossible? As you can see, the outcomes, the weights of the bags of M&M's, they really follow some sort of a normal distribution. If we agree that everything below 47 gram is a defect because it doesn't have enough chocolate in it and the customer might get upset. Everything above 53 is a defect because customers might sue us because they get obese. Or if we agree to those specifications, then we can draw a picture like this. You see the normal distribution and then at the tails are the defects. Now of course, if there's something we could do to reduce the standard deviation, to have less variation in the outcomes that would be good in the sense that we would have lower probabilities at the tails. You see here in this picture that in the upper distribution I can go three standard deviations from the mean before I'm going to hit the specification limit i.e before my bag becomes a defect. Now in the lower distribution, I can go six standard deviations before things go wrong. To capture that idea we'll introduce a new concept. That is a concept of process capability. We define the C_p score, where C stands for capability of the process, as the ratio between the difference of the upper specification limit, the USL, minus the lower specification limit, the LSL. We're going to divide that by six times the standard deviation in the process. In our M and M example, that gets me 53 minus 47 divided by 6 times 1.03. That is a number that is just about one that capability tells you how likely you are going to incur a defect. If you have many standard deviations between the mean and the specification limit, defects are unlikely. In the case of a Six Sigma process, CP is going to be equal to two. In that case, defects are highly unlikely. We're talking about two in a billion units. If you have a Three Sigma process, you're going to have three standard deviations from the mean to the defect level. Defects are probable, but very unlikely. If you only have a CP score of 0.333, you're going to have defects 31% of the time. The CP scores are really good way to capture the amount of variation in the process relative to the width of the specification interval. Now beyond analyzing chocolate, the capability analysis comes in handy when dealing with manufacturing tolerances. This is the context for which most of those quality machinery has been developed. For example, my friend and colleague Carl Oric has a kick scooter company. You see his product the Zooter in many urban centers around the world, here's a picture. A quality challenge for Carl has been the steer support common. If the unit is too small below 79.9 millimeter, the scooter starts to rattle, especially if you go over bumpy road. If the unit is bigger than 80 millimeters, it becomes hard to manufacture it. You really have to squeeze it in. What we did is we collected some data from its production process and we calculated the capability score. Again, it's a USL minus LSL. In this case it would be 80 millimeters minus 79.9 millimeters. We divide this by six times the empirical standard deviation that we found in his plan. To my great surprise, statistics worked. Those measurements were normally distributed. It turned out that the CP score for his factory, the capability of this process was almost exactly the same as the one for M and Ms. Crazy world. Time for practice problem. You see this very creative question about a chicken egg production process here with three sub-questions. As usual, put me on hold and see how far you can get on your own. Here we go again. The weight of the chicken eggs follows something that looks like a normal distribution. The weight is on average 47 grams. There's a standard deviation which we said is 3 grams. Then there's a specification limits, lower specification limit, LSL, which is 44, and an upper specification limit, USL, which is 50. Then the CP score, as we defined, is really the USL minus LSL divided by six times the standard deviation. In our problem here that is simply 50 minus 44 divided by six times three. That is one-third or six divided by 18, so 0.33 is the CP score. With that, we can look into the table that we have on the previous slide. The CP score of one-third means that you have a defect probability that you're outside the specification limits of 0.317. But the question I asked was, for insights, the specification within the specification limit, one minus it's stupid probability. That is 1 minus 0.317 and that gets us just around 68-69%. Next, this farmer or the chicken of this farmer, wants to become more consistent. To find the required standard deviation, we have to equate that CP score to two-thirds. Well, this is now an equation with one unknown. The unknown is really the required standard deviation. That is six divided by the six times sigma that we had before. That ratio has to be equal to two-thirds. We're going to solve now for sigma. This is a linear equation and Sigma. It's really not that hard to solve and we get a sigma of 1.5 grams. Quality problems result from variability. If you're always get it wrong, you will not be in business for long. If you always get it right, we wouldn't need a module on quality. This is a little like my serve in tennis. My first serve is too short and goes into the net, and the second serve is too long and it's called out. But on average, my serve is just fine. Once again, we are stuck talking about variability. In the next video, I want to introduce some definitions of variability that help us monitor process over time so that we rapidly detect when there exists some change in outcome. I see you then
