### 课程4.4 五个为什么框架：找到问题的根本原因

围绕**根本原因分析工具**展开，结合医疗行业案例与制造业经典模型，系统阐释了质量问题的溯源逻辑与结构化解决方法。

#### 1. 根本原因分析的核心框架

##### 1.1 五问分析法（Five Whys）

- **定义**：通过连续追问「为什么」（通常至少5次），穿透表象问题直至揭示根本原因。  
- **操作步骤**：  
  1. **问题定义**：医生无法在病历中找到实验室报告；  
  2. **逐层追问**：  
     ◦ *Why 1*：实验室未收到请求？→ 传真未被处理；  
     ◦ *Why 2*：为何仍用传真？→ 电子化迁移资源不足；  
     ◦ *Why 3*：资源不足？→ 医院IT预算分配优先级低。  
- **关键优势**：规避主观假设，聚焦系统性缺陷而非个体责任。

##### 1.2 鱼骨图（Ishikawa Diagram）

- **结构设计**：以「人机料法环测」为骨架（5M模型），分类归因问题：  
  - **医疗案例**：患者未执行检测（人力）、实验室设备故障（机器）、传真丢失（方法）、信息系统兼容性（环境）等；  
- **应用场景**：跨部门协作场景的头脑风暴工具，避免线性归因局限。

#### 2. 数据驱动的优先级判定工具

##### 2.1 帕累托图（Pareto Chart）

- **原理**：基于80/20法则，识别导致80%问题的关键20%原因：  
  - **数据收集**：统计100例病历缺失案例，发现65%源于传真系统故障；  
  - **行动优先级**：优先解决高频问题（如电子化升级）而非零星个案。  
- **对比价值树（KPI Trees）**：将定性讨论转化为量化决策依据，避免「会议室空谈」。

##### 2.2 根本原因判断标准

- **Rooney准则**：当原因满足以下条件时停止追问：  
  - 可控性（可通过管理干预解决）；  
  - 可预防性（存在系统性改进空间）；  
  - 经济性（解决成本低于问题重复发生成本）。  
- **案例**：实验室质控品处理不当→ SOP缺失（根因）而非员工失误（表象）。

#### 3. 行业应用启示与局限性

##### 3.1 医疗行业实践

- **问题暴露机制**：护士常通过「绕行问题」维持服务（如手工补录数据），但掩盖了IT系统缺陷；  
- **改进方向**：建立「检测-停止-警报」文化，赋予一线中断流程的权力（类似丰田安灯系统）。

##### 3.2 制造业经典案例

- **丰田停机事件**：  
  - *表象*：保险丝熔断 → *根因*：润滑泵未装滤网导致杂质进入；  
  - **管理启示**：简单更换零件是「假解决」，防错设计（Poka-Yoke）才能根治问题。

##### 3.3 工具局限性

- **数据依赖性**：鱼骨图依赖经验假设，帕累托图需真实数据验证；  
- **文化阻力**：问责制文化易导致「找替罪羊」而非系统改进（如归咎护士而非IT系统）。

#### 4. 质量管理思维升级路径

1. **从线性思维到系统思维**：  
   - 用五问法突破「就近归因」陷阱（如传真问题→预算分配）；  
   - 通过帕累托分析将资源投入高杠杆环节。  
2. **从经验决策到数据决策**：  
   - 建立缺陷数据库，量化根本原因分布（如每月TOP3问题追踪）；  
   - 结合控制图（Control Charts）实现过程稳定性监控。  
3. **从被动响应到预防文化**：  
   - 将根本原因分析纳入KPI考核（如根因解决率＞90%）；  
   - 通过防错设计降低人为失误概率（如电子化替代传真）。

#### 总结

根本原因分析的本质是**系统性反思与数据化决策的结合**。正如模块所述：「质量问题的解决不是终点，而是组织学习的起点。」 掌握五问分析法与帕累托原则，企业可将危机转化为改进契机，构建「问题暴露-学习-预防」的持续改进飞轮。

## 模块标题: Week 4: Quality

引言: 

Variability can introduce defects and hinder the pursuit of excellence. By recognizing and managing variability, organizations can lay the foundation for consistent and exceptional quality standards. This module introduces frameworks that provide systematic ways to analyze variability. We’ll look at how statistical analysis and problem-solving methodologies can enhance quality. We’ll also explore the power of real-time information and how it fosters continuous improvement. We’ll examine strategies for finding the root cause of an issue and explore how we might develop targeted solutions as we unravel complex problems.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine by how much the variation in the process needs to be reduced to meet a target defect rate (or capability score)
- Find the defect probabilities
- Determine the capability score of a process
- Explain the six sigma framework and the types of variation

### 第二章: Using Frameworks to Improve Quality/Tools for Your Operations Management Toolbox

#### 视频小节4: The Five Why Framework: Finding the Root Cause of a Problem

字幕文本: 

Once you have detected that your process has a problem, once you have stopped it and you've alerted the operator, you need to find the root cause of the problem. Again, an example from healthcare might help. Say you get alerted to the following problem. A doctor has ordered a lab, but that lab report is not in the medical record of the patient. I want you to spend two minutes thinking about why you're doctor who has requested a particular lab test to be done, might not see the results of that lab test in the patient's medical record. Pause the video, take two minutes by yourself, starting now.

So, what possible reasons did you come up with? Well, let me ask you a slightly different question. How did you go about the task? Here's what I did. I thought about the process from the doctor requesting the lab, to the doctor seeing the labs in the chart. In my imagination, that process looks something like that. The doctor puts in the lab order, the patient has to go to the lab. The lab has to do the test and upload the test results, and then the office has to update the chart with the lab results. So clearly, lots of things can go wrong along the way. I try to visualize this on this chart. All of these are reasons why the doctor cannot find the lab results in the chart. Some of these reasons are specific to the office, some to the doctor, some to the lab, and some to the patient. Lots of things that could go wrong. Let's visualize this. This graph is known as a fishbone diagram. The reason for that, I hope, is pretty self-explanatory when you look at the picture. For less obvious reason, It's also known as an Ishikawa diagram. Kaoru Ishikawa was a Japanese quality guru. And I guess that's what happens when you get famous. They start naming a graph after you. Once you have this fishbone or Ishikawa diagram on the table, you get a team of people together, and the team can now brainstorm why the lab reports are often missing from the charts. Really, the fishbone diagram gives this brainstorming some structure. It's better than just a long laundry list. Some experts propose to use the following labels as the main bones of your fish, machines, methods, materials, manpower, and measurement. That gives you 5 M's. Now, personally, I couldn't care less on how you label the bones of your fish. Just label them in whatever way that works for you, but you get the sense here. There are multiple potential root causes. Now, rather than talking about the 5 M's, I want to talk with you about the five whys. Sorry, I know that today I'm not sounding academically all that rigorous, but this is pretty helpful stuff. The five whys are really a famous quality tool that once again go back to Taiichi Ohno. Rather than just accepting the defect that you just got alerted to, you should ask why did this defect happen? For example, we can ask why did the lab not receive the request? Well, maybe because it was still faxed to them and now 90% of the requests come in electronically. Next we ask, well, why are they still faxing the request? Well, maybe that is because that one practice doesn't have the resources to migrate everything to electronic data transfer. But why? So again, you grow the chart and step by step you identify additional potential root causes. Now, it is important to know that the fishbone diagram is entirely a mental picture of what could have caused a problem. It is really not based on data. So, here's where our second tool for today comes in, and that is the Pareto chart. The fishbone diagram lists the potential root causes of the problem. The Pareto chart lists each of these potential causes, and then counts the frequency of their occurrence. How many times did that root cause contribute to the failure in the outcome variable? In other words, here's what you do. So, you look at the last hundred or so charts with missing labs, and you investigate why the labs were missing. You simply count the frequencies of the root causes. And then the Pareto chart sorts the root causes, starting with the most relevant, the most common root cause. And then what you do next is you can capture a line that counts the cumulative percentages across all those root causes. And the common empirical pattern then is that the vast majority of the problems can be explained by a very small set of root causes. This pattern is oftentimes known as Pareto principle or the 80-20 rule. That means that really 20% of the root causes explain 80% of the failures. Now, that insight is going to be super helpful when you're going eventually going to improve the process. In that sense, it somewhat resembles the value driver and the KPI trees. What I like about the Pareto analysis is that it turns problem-solving into an empirical exercise. I'm sure we all have spent countless hours sitting in meeting rooms and talked about problems and how to fix them. The fishbone diagram gives such a discussion a helpful structure, but it's really the Pareto chart that forces us to collect data. I also like the philosophy of the five why framework. More often than not, the root cause is not at the level of the operator or even at the level of the process. You notice that our idea of the root cause of the problem is shifting as we continue to ask why. Initially we want to blame the nurse, now we are blaming the hospital management for not updating the IT system. Now, as much as I like this framework, in the next video I want to talk about some of its limitations.
