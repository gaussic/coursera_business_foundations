## 模块标题: Week 4: Quality

引言: 

Variability can introduce defects and hinder the pursuit of excellence. By recognizing and managing variability, organizations can lay the foundation for consistent and exceptional quality standards. This module introduces frameworks that provide systematic ways to analyze variability. We’ll look at how statistical analysis and problem-solving methodologies can enhance quality. We’ll also explore the power of real-time information and how it fosters continuous improvement. We’ll examine strategies for finding the root cause of an issue and explore how we might develop targeted solutions as we unravel complex problems.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine by how much the variation in the process needs to be reduced to meet a target defect rate (or capability score)
- Find the defect probabilities
- Determine the capability score of a process
- Explain the six sigma framework and the types of variation

#### 视频小节3: The Power of Quick Feedback

字幕文本: 

When I was a student in business and computer science at the University of Manheim, all my grades for my diploma, almost five years of studies were determined within a couple of weeks. I would take my courses in computer network design, econometrics or production planning. But I would basically get no feedback that I had completed all courses and it would enroll in the final examination process. The fact that these were four, five hour long exams then followed by all examinations that were held in public didn't make this any more fun. Contrast this with the approach of frequent testing and examination that we now have in most business schools and colleges. It doesn't matter if you want to improve your tennis serve or your operations management skills, learning and improvement is based on feedback. And the sooner you can get that feedback, the faster will you learn. In today's video, I want to talk about quick feedback. Sakichi Toyota, the founder of the Toyota Company, had invented the power loom at the end of the 19th century. It was the first automated loom. Now that the loom was automated, it did not need an operator. But then, what do you do when things go wrong? Now, in his brilliance, Mr. Toyota had the idea that the loom itself should detect if it was running out of threat or something else was broken. And in that case it should stop and alert an operator to come, detect, stop, alert. Whenever there's a problem in a process, it is critical that we quickly recognize that there's a problem. We then need to stop what we're doing and we need to alert management or our coworkers to fix the problem and to think about preventing that problem in the future. Why is that a good idea? An analogy from coaching might again be helpful. If you're coaching somebody how to play tennis, how to swim, or how to sing. Providing feedback is critical and feedback is the most useful, really, when it is given quickly. So really, in the remainder of the video, we'll talk about detecting when something abnormal happens, after all defects, hopefully something abnormal in the operation. And we want to do that detection as quickly as possible. Now I'm by no means a school of the Japanese language, but the term Jidoka is a simple Wikipedia search reveals stands for automation and some degree of self consciousness or self awareness. And so the loom in the Toyota plant is realizing by itself that it is broken. Hence this idea of Jidoka detect, stop, alert. Now, when Toyota moved into the assembly line world for the automotive production, they basically embodied the principle of Jidoka into something that is known as the andon cord. The andon cord is literally a court that runs adjacent to the assembly line. The workers on the line are empowered to pull the cord when they detect a problem. When that happens, the line is stopped and through the andon board, which is a board that you see here on this picture. The supervisor is alerted of the problem, detect, stop, alert. This alert then triggers some form of problem solving intervention. So the andon cord supports a quick feedback to the operators and to the format. A huge hindrance or a huge delay when it comes to feedback has to do with inventory. Imagine you have a process flow and you have two consecutive resources with the buffer in between. Say for sake of argument, the processing times at each of the resources are 1 minute per unit. Now imagine we are making these circuits here one by one. But at some point the first resource makes a mistake. Instead of producing a circuit, say it produces a square. Ask yourself how long will it take the second resource to find out about the mistake? Well, if there's a lot of inventory, for example if there are six or seven units of inventory in between the stations and the flow is at 1 minute per flow unit, in that case it would take six or seven minutes until the second resource realizes that there's a mistake. But what happens in the meantime? Well, chances are that the first resource since it didn't get any feedback keeps on making the same stupid mistake. Now, in contrast, imagine we would reduce the inventory level and we would only have one or two units in the buffer between the two resources. Again, what happens when the first resource makes a mistake? Now the feedback comes in much quicker. We thereby learn faster and avoid that we make further mistakes. So you notice that really inventory is delaying the feedback. Inventory is covering up defect, that is why it's oftentimes referred to as one of the most evil sources of waste. An often used visualization of this effect that inventory is covering up defects and problems is in the form of this picture, a boat on the river. Imagine you're operating a canal or lake and in that lake you have a bunch of rocks. You're using these boats here with an expensive cargo and so you really want to avoid that the boat hits the rock. So what do you do? Well, on the one hand it's very tempting to increase the water level. That makes it just less likely that the boat ever hits the rock. And what's wrong with that? Well, now that the water is so high, you'll actually don't see the rocks and you'll always have them underneath the surface. The opposing argument is that rather than increasing the water level you should actually decrease it. Yes, you will face a short term problem in the sense that you might bump into a rock but it's the only way that makes you sure that the rock ultimately is removed. And once you've removed the rock, what do you do? Instead of comfortably sailing, you're then going to reduce the water level again. You get ready for removing the next rock. The same can be said about buffer and inventory. Rather than buffering every problems, setups transports poor line balancings or defects away. The idea of the Toyota production system is to reduce your inventory so that those problems get exposed. Only once the problems are exposed will you see the problem and have the pressure to solve them. And then you don't rest on your laurels, but you reduce the inventory further. Now, we talked about Kanban cards in the lien module. Kanban cards come in as a way for management to intentionally to purposefully reduce the inventory level in the process. Remember from the lien module that you can never have more inventory than you authorize through the Kanban cards. So exposing problems instead of hiding them is a key to Jidoka. Another way to provide feedback to those operating the process is the use of statistics. This is the idea of statistical process control or control charts. What you're doing is you're tracking an outcome variable, such as the weight of M and M, such as the curvature of a cucumber or the height of a steer support column, and you're tracking that number over time. You're mapping that out in a graph that includes two limits known as a control limits. They're basically the 95th percentile confidence intervals of past data. So when the current observed unit falls out of that interval, you know something abnormal, most likely something wrong has happened. Now, please don't confuse these control limits, which are based on the 95th percent interval of past data that you observed in the process. Please don't confuse those with specification limits that are introduced into the video of Six sigma. Specification limits come from the customer. Control limits come from past process performance. Again, such data provide you feedback to what extent the process is currently deviating from past performance. Now, from the automated looms of Sakichi Toyota to monitoring a process continuously using statistics, the principle of Jidokais, in my view, an evergreen. When something abnormal happens, I want to somehow detect it as quickly as possible. And I, as a manager of the process, want to be alerted sooner rather than later. Detect, stop, alert one more thought about the stopping part of Jidoka. Why do you think it is important to stop the line? One reason clearly is that it makes little sense to keep on running a machine that is broken. It's just like trying to run a job through a jam printer. But there's another beauty in the stop part of Jidoka. By stopping normal operation, in the case of a plant, by stopping the production line, we send a very clear signal that something is wrong. We focus attention on fixing the problem. That is in sharp contrast to what I oftentimes see in healthcare. My former colleague Anita Tucker, now at Boston University, has done a number of studies on what nurses do when they encounter a problem. What do they do? They work around the problem they improvise, they find a solution so that they couldn't go on with their work and help the patient. Now, notice that such behavior is first and foremost something that we should applaud. And maybe this is a good moment for us to say thank you to all the nurses and caregivers for the great work and service they provide to society. But even if the nurse files a report about that problem afterwards, more often than not, nothing happens. The organization never develops a sense of urgency. After all, management knows that whenever the next problem pops up, the nurse will once again improvise and find a solution. So stopping the process is a big deal. It puts long term quality over short term revenue goals. With that being said, it is time for me to stop and I see you in the next video.
