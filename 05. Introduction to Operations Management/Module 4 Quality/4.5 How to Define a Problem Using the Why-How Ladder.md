### 课程4.5 如何使用「为什么-如何」阶梯来定义问题  

围绕 **问题定义工具Why-How Ladder（为什么-如何阶梯）** 与 **防错设计** 展开，结合流行病防控与租车行业案例，系统阐释了质量问题的多层次定义与解决方案设计逻辑。

#### 1. Why-How Ladder：问题定义的动态框架

##### 1.1 逻辑结构与核心思想

- **Why（向上追问）**：通过连续追问「为什么」拓宽问题视角，从具体现象（如「缩短排队时间」）上升到抽象目标（如「提升客户体验」），避免陷入局部优化陷阱。  
  - *案例*：赫兹租车（Hertz）将「缩短排队时间」重新定义为「如何让客户更快抵达目的地」，最终推出「黄金会员免排队取车」服务，彻底重构流程。  
- **How（向下拆解）**：从抽象目标拆解为具体行动（如「优化口罩分发点布局」），确保解决方案可落地。  

##### 1.2 与五问分析法（Five Whys）的互补性

- **局限性突破**：五问法易将问题引向不可控的宏观层面（如口罩短缺归因于国家供应链政策），而Why-How Ladder通过动态调整问题层级，平衡深度与可行性。  
- **嵌套模型应用**：结合Donabedian医疗质量模型（结构-流程-结果），从结果反推流程缺陷，再溯源至结构性问题（如校园防疫中的口罩供应链与政策设计）。

#### 2. 防错设计（Poka-Yoke与Baka-Yoke）的层次化实践

##### 2.1 防错等级划分

- **Poka-Yoke（防误）**：通过设计避免无意识错误，例如：  
  - *基础层*：交通法规强制车辆与自行车保持安全距离；  
  - *物理层*：自行车道震动装置，车辆偏离时触发触觉反馈。  
- **Baka-Yoke（防呆）**：极端防错设计，需故意破坏才能触发错误，例如独立自行车道网络（荷兰模式），彻底隔离风险。  

##### 2.2 行业应用案例

- **制造业**：丰田润滑泵滤网设计（通过五问法发现杂质侵入是轴承损坏的根因）；  
- **服务业**：医院电子处方系统自动校验剂量，避免人工输入错误。  

#### 3. 质量管理的关键思维升级

##### 3.1 问题定义的三重原则

- **开放性问题导向**：使用「How might we...」句式（如「如何提升校园口罩佩戴率？」），避免隐含预设答案；  
- **动态层级调节**：根据资源与时间约束，选择适中的问题粒度（如疫情初期优先解决口罩供应，而非改造社交结构）；  
- **数据验证闭环**：结合帕累托图（Pareto Chart）量化根因分布，优先解决高频问题（如80%感染源于20%的聚集场景）。  

##### 3.2 系统稳健性构建

- **变异性隔离**：通过防错设计降低输入波动对结果的影响（如独立自行车道隔离交通风险）；  
- **流程容错性**：设计冗余机制（如医疗系统中的「检测-停止-警报」文化），允许局部失败但不扩散至系统崩溃。  

#### 4. 工具整合与行动指南

1. **Why-How Ladder实战步骤**：  
   - Step 1：用「How might we...」定义初始问题；  
   - Step 2：向上追问3-5层「Why」扩展问题边界；  
   - Step 3：向下拆解3-5层「How」生成具体方案池；  
   - Step 4：选择最优问题层级与解决方案组合。  

2. **防错设计优先级矩阵**：  
   | 防错等级 | 成本 | 有效性 | 适用场景 |  
   |----------|------|--------|----------|  
   | 法规/标识 | 低 | 弱 | 初期风险防控 |  
   | 物理隔离 | 高 | 极强 | 高风险核心流程 |  
   | 自动化校验 | 中 | 强 | 高频人工操作环节 |

#### 总结

本模块揭示了质量管理的核心矛盾：**在变异性不可避免的现实中，通过系统设计将「错误」转化为「不可能」**。Why-How Ladder与防错工具的组合，为管理者提供了从问题定义到解决方案的全链条方法论。正如爱因斯坦所言：「问题的定义比解决更重要」，在动态调整问题层级的实践中，企业可突破局部优化陷阱，实现「稳健性」与「创新性」的双重跃迁。

## 模块标题: Week 4: Quality

引言: 

Variability can introduce defects and hinder the pursuit of excellence. By recognizing and managing variability, organizations can lay the foundation for consistent and exceptional quality standards. This module introduces frameworks that provide systematic ways to analyze variability. We’ll look at how statistical analysis and problem-solving methodologies can enhance quality. We’ll also explore the power of real-time information and how it fosters continuous improvement. We’ll examine strategies for finding the root cause of an issue and explore how we might develop targeted solutions as we unravel complex problems.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine by how much the variation in the process needs to be reduced to meet a target defect rate (or capability score)
- Find the defect probabilities
- Determine the capability score of a process
- Explain the six sigma framework and the types of variation

### 第二章: Using Frameworks to Improve Quality/Tools for Your Operations Management Toolbox

#### 视频小节5: How to Define a Problem Using the Why-How Ladder

字幕文本: 

In the last video, we talked about the Five Why Framework. We kept on asking why until we got deeper into the problem. And once we found the root cause, we wanted to eliminate it so that future problems don't occur. You also notice that by asking why? We shifted from looking at the problem as a bad outcome. To looking at the problem as a poor process, to ultimately looking at the bigger structure. Outcomes are determined by processes, and processes are designed in the bigger structure. This nesting of structure, process, and outcome is pretty common across industries. In healthcare, it is known as a Donabedian model of quality. It is named after Avedis Donabedian, a physician and formerly a professor at the University of Michigan. Moving from outcome to process and from process to structure is something I do like about the Five Why Framework. In today's video, I want to talk about some limitations of the tool. However, I also want to introduce you to a related tool that I found very effective for this type of work. So here we go. Consider the case of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. And the various measures that a community like our university or a business can take to limit the number of infections. As we know from epidemiology. The spread of the virus can be slowed or even entirely stopped by adhering to standards of hygiene and social distancing. In the world of operations management, we would refer to new infections as bad outcomes and thus defects. Every day there are thousands of interactions between members of the community. And some of them, knowingly or not, are infected with countless opportunities for infection and dust defects. Now, the vast majority of these interactions cause no infection, but heck, some of them do. We thus have, again a variation in outcome. If that variation consisted only of randomness, we would refer to this as a common cause variation. If, however, as it has been documented in numerous studies. Some transmissions occur because of poor adherence to good hygiene standards and social distancing. We speak of assignable cause variation. Next, let's look at the usefulness of the 5 Why Framework. Let's think about a student here at Warden who got infected early on in the pandemic, say spring of 2020. Why did the student get infected? Well, because he or she interacted with other students not wearing a face mask. Well, why did the student not wear a face mask? Well, because at least in April of 2020, it was hard to get good face masks here in Philadelphia. Well, why was it hard to get a face mask in Philadelphia in April 2020? Well, because the US faced a massive shortage of personal protective equipment. Why did the US face a massive shortage of personal protective equipment? You see where I'm going with this. We've started out with a very concrete problem of infection control here on campus. And before we notice, we are now facing a problem that is deeply involved in the world of politics. If you're interested in the PPE supply chain topic. Let me know and I'll share with you an editorial that the CEO of Penn Madison. My colleague Kevin Vaup, and I wrote about the limitations of just in time supply chains. But to emphasize my point, this is not a problem that can be solved next week. So let me articulate a different process of defining the problem. Albert Einstein allegedly said if I were given one hour to save the planet. I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and 1 minute to solve it. Whether this is true or not can be debated, but clearly a good problem definition is critical. You begin the process of defining the process by stating the problem. I like to state problems starting with the words how might we? Or in what ways might we? Because that language is open ended and really focuses on the problem rather than already baking in a solution. For example, we frame a quality project preventing COVID. As how might we increase the adherence to facial mask wearing here on campus? Write this statement down. Again, start with how might we? Or in what ways? Next, let's apply the logic of the five whys? Ask yourself why? Why would we want to do that? What would be good about that? In our case, the answer might be, well, because it would increase compliance with good hygiene standards. Why, what would be good about that? Well, it would reduce the spread of COVID infections. And again ask yourself why? What would be good about that? We might say, well, that would lead to a healthier and safer campus environment. Now, nothing wrong with that, but do you really want to have your team work on the problem? How might we create a healthy and safe campus environment? Again, I think you get my point as we keep on asking why, we're at risk of making the problem too broad. So how about doing the opposite? Rather than asking why, let's simply ask how. One way in which we might be able to address a problem. How might we increase the adherence to facial mask wearing on campus is by reminding people to wear a mask. Another approach would be to make masks more widely available. So we might now think of the problem how might we increase the availability of face masks here on campus? But we could focus our problem even further. For example, we might ask how might we conveniently locate face masks? At some point, however, you really run the risk that you make the problem too specific, too narrow. That creates such a narrow problem definition that you're really ruling out many effective solution approaches. That might prevent the spread of the virus with less effort and at lower cost. So my point is this quality problems can be stated at various levels of specificity. What I want you to do is to deliberately to purposely to intentionally consider alternative problem statements. Write them down from the specific to the general. The why how letter is really a very helpful tool that helps you in this exercise. Eventually, I want you to pick a problem formulation that you feel comfortable with. And in case of doubt, I suggest you err on the side of making the problem a little broader than you first envisioned it. Let me illustrate the power of the why-how ladder. As an approach towards defining problems, using an example of the rental car company Hertz. Hertz, a number of years ago, oftentimes faces a problem of long lines. And has long waiting times at the airport rental car stations, which is arguably a really bad quality outcome. Now, a natural way to frame the problem thus is to how might we shorten the time in line? When you do this, you really take the current process as a given. And most likely you end up with improvements such as better staffing or faster computers. Now, don't get me wrong. These are exactly the type of solutions we talked about in much of the earlier parts of this course. So I really like that. But how about this? Let's ask why? Why would we want to shorten the line? Or what would be good about a shorter line? By doing so, we broaden the problem. So why shorten the line? Well, we really want customers to get out on their way to the destinations faster. Isn't that interesting? Now, we could tackle the problem. How might we get our customer to their way to the destination faster? That is a related, but it's a different problem. We just broadened the problem. This allows us really to think outside the box. Maybe we don't need a line at all. How about customers go right to the car? How about the car waits for them at the gate? Ultimately, the idea of Hertz Gold was that frequent flyers. Frequent customers of Hertz, would just go right to their cars without standing in line at all. That, however, was not a solution that you would have come up with if you had only worked on the initial problem. How might we have shortened the line? All right, I think I digressed a little bit here. We're in the quality module, and your professor is talking about waiting lines. So back to quality. My idea behind the why-how letter is that you now have a framework that can help you define any type of problem. And of course, that includes quality problems. But really, quality problems are somewhat special as they relate to deviations from standards and specifications. So are there any specific tools, any standard tricks that we can play when dealing with quality problems? Thank you for asking. If you want to avoid bad outcomes, we have to reduce variation in the process. And we have to avoid that these variations lead to bad outcome. That was really the whole idea behind the Swiss cheese model. So how can we avoid such deviations? And how can we avoid that such deviations that still exist don't lead to that bad outcome? For that, we have to build processes that are failsafe. Experts oftentimes talk about foolproofing a process. The term might be perceived as somewhat disrespectful and offensive. So jumping into the Japanese language once again might be helpful. Let me define poka yoke as preventing mistakes from happening. Now, strictly speaking, with poka yoke, mistakes should not happen inadvertently. Gross negligence or really evil intent by the operator could still trigger a bad outcome. Baka yoke in contrast means literally fool proofing an operation. And baka yoke can thus be thought of as really an extreme form of poka yoke. Now, the effort required to make a mistake with baka yoke would go up dramatically. You really have to try hard to make a defect. Now, these two terms capture the idea of a robust process that I mentioned in the first video of this module. A process is robust when random variations in input and environmental variables. Which includes accidental mistakes, are avoided. And it's really robust when not even a fool can trigger a bad outcome. As a difference between these definitions of baka yoke and poka yoke suggests there are really multiple levels of error prevention. Take the example of boka safety, a topic that you know by now is really close to my heart. The most basic protection comes in the form of traffic law. Traffic law in Pennsylvania states that drivers have to pass me a cyclist with a 4ft distance. Now, most drivers don't know that law, but it's good to know that the law is on my side when I get hit by the truck. The next level more fierce if is to put a sign near the road. I hate those signs. They say share the road or watch for cyclists. The reasons why I share those signs is they have little impact on the drivers. Their view of sharing the road is simply different from mine. But at least it's better than doing nothing. The next level more fear safe would be not just to have a sign, but clear markings on the road. In Philly, we fortunately have a number of bike lanes. They work pretty well, except for more recently, they have really turned the bike lanes into uber dropoff and pickup lines. The fourth level of making a process more robust is often referred to as a multisensory. Now, an undesirable action is really hard on the operator. Look at these little barriers here. If that SUV driver wants to kill me, he or she can still do so. But now they really need to make an effort. Drivers who accidentally drift over into the bike lane, they get a very strong feedback in the form of their cars starting to rattle. The ultimate fool proof way to keep our cyclists safe is to give us our own road network. You see, this really a lot in Holland and throughout Europe. And to be fair, Philadelphia really has a great number of such bike paths. Now even our stupid and evil driver would not be able to hit the cyclist. The five whys and the why-how ladder are great tools that can help you think about a problem at different levels of analysis. These tools don't provide you with answers, but they do steer you towards asking the right questions. When it comes to quality problems, most of the action is making workers adherent to some standards and some specifications. The five levels of prevention and fool proofing are not giving you an easy answer. But they force you to think about alternative ways to look for solutions. So I hope you found them useful as well. That's all I got for today. I'll see you next time.
