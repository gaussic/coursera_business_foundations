## 模块标题: Week 4: Quality

引言: 

Variability can introduce defects and hinder the pursuit of excellence. By recognizing and managing variability, organizations can lay the foundation for consistent and exceptional quality standards. This module introduces frameworks that provide systematic ways to analyze variability. We’ll look at how statistical analysis and problem-solving methodologies can enhance quality. We’ll also explore the power of real-time information and how it fosters continuous improvement. We’ll examine strategies for finding the root cause of an issue and explore how we might develop targeted solutions as we unravel complex problems.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine by how much the variation in the process needs to be reduced to meet a target defect rate (or capability score)
- Find the defect probabilities
- Determine the capability score of a process
- Explain the six sigma framework and the types of variation

### 第一章: Variability and Quality

#### 视频小节1: How Variability Causes Quality Problems

字幕文本: 

In some of the previous modules, we talked about variation and flow. We saw that this variation was a result of variation in demand and variation within our process. In this module, we'll continue our focus on variation. However, we shift from the process flow perspective to looking at the actual work and the quality with which it is performed. To motivate some of the challenges associated risk consistently obtaining a high-quality outcome, let us look at the story of my bike crash that I told you at the beginning of this course. I want to use this example to illustrate the role of variability in the occurrence of events such as an accident, a defect, or medical error. My bike which happened on a Saturday morning, the break cable turned loose and got stuck between the spinning wheel and the fork which slice the fork into two pieces and send me headfirst over the handle box. How could such an accident happen and what was the role of variability? Well, like most always in life, lots of fact, lots of variables come together. In the case of my bike rash, I was somewhat late for my team ride and so I didn't check my bike as carefully as I usually do. Also, I didn't have the bike bypassing the mechanic for a while because it was early in the season and the mechanic had a huge backlog so it wouldn't have taken much and this whole crash would never have happened. But it won't take much either and the whole question would have been a lot worse. I got lucky on multiple fronts. That morning, I had an ambulance picking me up in minutes. My helmet took most of the crash and the pen trauma center said I had a relatively light morning. Again, lots of things come together and they co-determine the outcome. Take a look at this figure here. Customers and resources influence a number of input variables. These are variables describing how the process is operated, as well as the variables capturing human or machine behavior. In the case of my bike ride, the input variables are things that I controlled. Did I leave on time? Did I check my bike? Did I bring the bike to the mechanic as needed? Most importantly, did I wear a helmet? In addition to this input variables, there exists a number of environmental variables that also impact the quality. In contrast to input variables, environmental variables are not directly under the control of the operation. In the case of my bike ride, the fact that there was an idle ambulance nearby wasn't environmental variable so was the quality of the road pavement and the weather. Input and environmental variables come together and they co-determine the outcome variable of the process. In the case of my crash, the outcome that I was discharged from the trauma center the same day with little permanent damage other than having a bunch of fake teeth. Other outcome measures might be customer satisfaction, net promoter score, or defect on an assembly line. Again, note that many input and environmental variables together, they co-determine the outcome. Since we have variability in input and environmental variables, we will have variability in the outcome variables. Typically when bad things happen, a number of things have to be lined up against us. This effect is often called the Swiss cheese model. I kid you not. The Swiss cheese model is really a technical term in the quality management literature. The idea here is that a process is like a stack of slices of Swiss cheese. But it's very unlikely that you put 10 random slices of Swiss cheese on top of each other and still be able to see through the stack. It's possible. Just x plus cheese has random holds. Processes have random variations. When there's a bad outcome happening, multiple sources of randomness are typically stacked up against you. This better alignment of sources of variation is just like being able to see through the entire stack of Swiss cheese. Really bad outcomes don't happen because of one deviation in the process. They tend to be the result of many small problems. Disasters strike when all the holes in the Swiss cheese line up. Enough of this Swiss cheese stuff. Let's talk a little bit more about quality. Now, when you're diagnosing a bad outcome, that's called this a defect, we need to find the input or the environmental variables that cause a defect. Those variables will be called the root cause of the defect. Now, even in a well-managed operation, input variables and environmental variables will always suffer from some randomness and that will yield variation and the quality of the outcome. Note that quality problems or there's always variability problems. Since we never can eliminate all variables in the process, we want to build processes in which variability in input and environmental variables do not automatically translate into a bad outcome. Such processes are called robust processes. A process is robust if it's still leads to a good outcome, even when there's variability in inputs and environmental variables. In the remainder of the module, I want to talk about how to use this framework to improve quality. Understanding the source of variation in the process is really the first step. In the next session I'm going to talk about how to quantify variation in a process. In particular, I will introduce the concept of Six Sigma and process capability. We then move on to discuss how you monitor the current process behavior over time. We'll determine if the variation that you measure in the process at a particular moment in time is just random noise or whether it should be seen as something abnormal. We want to find defects as quickly and as early as possible so that we can intervene. In that context, we're talking about control charts to detect stop alert method, and the need for quick feedback. Once we know that something bad has happened in our process, we have to take action, and for this, we have to find the root cause. To find the root cause, we will discuss the 5-Why framework, fishbone diagrams, and Pareto charts. Then finally, once you have found your root causes, you have to eliminate them. You have to prevent the root causes from leading to better outcomes again in the future. For that, I'll show you a couple of frameworks including the Whitehall letter and fool proofing a process, ie, making it more robust. Well, that's a roadmap for this quality module. I have to confess that this narrative is not always the exact way that quality problems are tackled in practice. But I wanted to give you a big picture framework on how the set of tools that we will discuss in this module fit together. I find all of these tools helpful. Otherwise, I would not have included them in this course. Which ones you will use the most in your work will certainly depend on what type of work you're doing. In my view of the qualitative non-mathematical tools in many operations course is done when they get the attention that it deserves. Frameworks like to detect stop alert method, root cause problem-solving, and the Whitehall later, none of them might end up on the final exam. But in my experience, all of them have been super useful tools to have in your operations management toolbox. I see you in the next video.
