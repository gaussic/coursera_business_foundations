## Coursera 商业基础课程《运营管理导论》 - 模块4 - 质量

### 课程4.6 PDCA循环

以**PDCA循环**为核心，整合了质量管理全链条方法论，从变异性分析到持续改进闭环，构建了完整的质量管理系统框架。

#### 1. PDCA循环的核心逻辑与实施步骤

##### 1.1 PDCA四阶段定义

- **Plan（计划）**：基于历史数据与根因分析（如鱼骨图、帕累托图）制定改进方案，需明确目标、资源分配及风险预案。  
- **Do（执行）**：小范围试运行改进措施（如调整生产线参数、优化流程节点），强调「快速验证假设」而非全面铺开。  
- **Check（检查）**：通过控制图（Control Charts）监控改进效果，量化指标（如缺陷率、流程能力指数Cpk）验证假设。  
- **Act（处理）**：标准化有效改进（如更新SOP文档），遗留问题转入下一循环，形成持续改进飞轮。  

##### 1.2 PDCA的嵌套特性

- **大环套小环**：企业级战略改进（如六西格玛项目）与部门级流程优化（如生产线防错设计）形成嵌套式循环。  
- **阶梯式上升**：每个循环解决部分问题，推动质量水平螺旋提升（如M&M产线σ从1.03克降至0.5克）。  

#### 2. PDCA与质量管理工具的整合应用

##### 2.1 根因分析与计划阶段

- **鱼骨图（5M模型）**：从人、机、料、法、环维度归因问题（如医疗实验室报告缺失案例）。  
- **帕累托图（80/20法则）**：识别高频缺陷源（如80%感染风险源于20%聚集场景），优先分配资源。  

##### 2.2 执行与检查阶段

- **统计过程控制（SPC）**：使用控制图区分随机波动（Common Cause）与异常信号（Assignable Cause），触发「检测-停止-警报」机制。  
- **过程能力指数（Cpk）**：计算公式：  
  \[
  Cpk = \min\left(\frac{USL - \mu}{3\sigma}, \frac{\mu - LSL}{3\sigma}\right)
  \]  
  目标Cpk≥1.33（4σ水平），若牛肉宠物食品案例中Cpk=0.83，需降低σ至1.67克以达成六西格玛目标。  

##### 2.3 处理阶段的标准化与防错

- **防错设计（Poka-Yoke）**：通过物理限制（如独立自行车道）或自动化校验（如电子处方剂量检测）降低人为失误。  
- **白厅信函法**：书面记录改进措施与责任人，确保知识沉淀与跨部门协同（如医疗IT系统升级项目）。  

#### 3. PDCA的行业应用场景

##### 3.1 制造业案例

- **丰田安灯系统**：产线工人拉绳停线（Do阶段）→ 根因分析（5Why法发现润滑泵滤网缺失）→ 标准化滤网安装流程（Act阶段）。  
- **M&M巧克力生产**：通过PDCA循环将包装重量σ从1.03克降至0.5克，Cpk从1提升至2（六西格玛水平）。  

##### 3.2 服务业案例

- **赫兹租车流程优化**：  
  - *初始问题*：机场取车排队时间长（Cpk=0.5）；  
  - *PDCA应用*：重新定义目标为「客户快速抵达目的地」（Plan）→ 推出「黄金会员免排队」（Do）→ 监控客户满意度（Check）→ 标准化会员服务体系（Act）。  

##### 3.3 医疗行业案例

- **实验室报告缺失**：通过鱼骨图识别传真系统漏洞（Plan）→ 试点电子化传输（Do）→ 统计报告完整性提升率（Check）→ 全院推广IT升级（Act）。  

#### 4. 习启示与行动指南

1. **从数据到决策的闭环**：  
   - 结合DMAIC（定义、测量、分析、改进、控制）框架，将PDCA嵌入六西格玛项目（如降低医疗感染率）。  
   - 使用Python或Minitab自动化生成控制图与Cpk报告，缩短分析周期。  

2. **文化变革杠杆**：  
   - **管理层承诺**：将PDCA纳入KPI考核（如每个部门季度完成1个改进循环）；  
   - **一线赋权**：培训员工使用5Why分析法，建立「问题暴露无惩罚」文化（类似丰田Jidoka理念）。  

3. **动态资源分配**：  
   - 通过帕累托分析聚焦高价值问题（如20%缺陷消耗80%成本），优先分配研发与运维资源。

#### 总结

本模块揭示了质量管理的本质是 **「用科学方法论驯服变异性」**。PDCA循环作为改进引擎，整合了六西格玛、根因分析与防错设计，将「救火式应对」升级为「预防性卓越」。正如戴明所述：「质量不是检验出来的，而是设计到流程中的。」掌握PDCA与配套工具，企业可在成本、效率与客户价值间找到最优平衡，构建**自我迭代的学习型组织**。

## 模块标题: Week 4: Quality

引言: 

Variability can introduce defects and hinder the pursuit of excellence. By recognizing and managing variability, organizations can lay the foundation for consistent and exceptional quality standards. This module introduces frameworks that provide systematic ways to analyze variability. We’ll look at how statistical analysis and problem-solving methodologies can enhance quality. We’ll also explore the power of real-time information and how it fosters continuous improvement. We’ll examine strategies for finding the root cause of an issue and explore how we might develop targeted solutions as we unravel complex problems.

Learning Objectives:
- Determine by how much the variation in the process needs to be reduced to meet a target defect rate (or capability score)
- Find the defect probabilities
- Determine the capability score of a process
- Explain the six sigma framework and the types of variation

### 第二章: Using Frameworks to Improve Quality/Tools for Your Operations Management Toolbox

#### 视频小节6: The PDCA Cycle

字幕文本: 

There's one last piece of content that I wanted to share with you as part of this module on quality. Just like the Why How letter, it is really a broader tool, and it doesn't squarely fit into any of the boxes that I had outlined at the beginning of the module. But I should not teach a module on quality without talking about this concept, which is known as the PDCA cycle. Today, give me a few minutes to talk about the PDCA cycle and then I will wrap up the module. So here we go. PDCA stands for plan, do, check, and act. With really everything that we discussed in this module, we're now well equipped to plan some process changes. Planning consists in a large part of analyzing past performance data. This should include things such as the Fishbone diagram, the Pareto charts, but it might also include other elements that we've discussed in the course, such as process flow diagrams, or OE charts. The Do piece is then about trying out a change, for example, you just thought about a way of preventing a major root cause from happening again. Maybe you found a way to offload the bottleneck, sounds like a good idea, but will it work? You really cannot plan your way to success, at some point, you have to just try stuff out. Taking action is at the Do part in the D of PDCA, Check then stands for the evaluation of your action, whether or not that change works, that's really an empirical question. Just like hypothesis in other sciences are either supported or rejected by data, our process improvement idea is a speculative hypothesis as long as it hasn't been evaluated in practice. And then finally Act, Act stands for acting on what you have learned in the experiment. If the experiment confirmed that the process change was a good one, you want to make it part of the standard of your work going forward. A famous or somewhat cheesy saying in the process improvement community is that the road to quality has no end. I know, again, somewhat cheesy, but there's something in here, there's always something that you can do to improve the process further, that's what I like about the PDCA cycle. A cycle has no beginning and no end. You keep it on cycling through PDCA and hopefully along the way, your operations are going to improve. The PDCA cycle is also known as a Deming Cycle, which honors the work of William Edwards Deming who was a pioneer in the quality management community. Deming was instrumental in importing statistically rigorous approaches to learning and experimentation into the fields of operation management. That gets me to my last point in this module and maybe throughout this course, and that is a combination of theory and empirical data. Good operations, in my view, just like in any science, requires an iteration between the real world, which tends to be messy and dirty and complex, and the academic tools that I taught you in the scores. All right, let me summarize. This module was really light on math, only one equation here on the capability score, but very heavy on definition. I have a long list of vocabulary here for you to learn, but maybe more importantly, allow me to switch over and review the big picture of the narrative of quality management. We started this module with measuring variation, it was the idea behind capability analysis. Whether we managed cucumbers steering support parts or bags. There are capability scores which capture the likelihood that a real life observation is outside the specifications. Once we understood the variables in the process, we could conduct a conformance analysis to see whether or not our process is behaving in line with past behavior. If there's something abnormal going on, either statistically detected or detected by an operator, we want to do Detect-Stop-Alert, Jidoka. Once we are stopping, we want to understand the root cause of why we are stopping. Why did we have the problem in the first place? That got us to the 5-Why framework, the Fishbone diagram, and the Pareto chart. And then finally, we talked about process improvement, in particular, the concept of the Why How Ladder. How might we go about improving the process? And how can we make the process more robust, so that future variations in input or environmental variables will not again lead to a bad outcome? That together creates a Damning Cycle. It is really a loop of problem solving, a loop of quality improvement that never ends. All right, are you ready for the one practice problem of the module? Here it comes, I'm not sure it's all that creative, but for one last time, put me on hold and try it by yourself.

All right, so let's look at this together. So we have these weights of the beef pets, and in the following I didn't say this explicitly, but let's just assume they follow some sort of a normal distribution. The mean we said is 250, the standard deviation is 4 grams, and the specification limits are 240 and 260, so that's the interval. And so, then when we compute a CP score, we look at CPS 260 minus 240, upper specification limit minus lower specification limit. And we're going to divide this by six times the standard deviation, and that is, in this case here, 20 divided by 24. So if you want to make sure that this is a six sigma process, a CP score has to be equals to 2 now, we're not going to use a generic, not four, but a generic standard deviation. And so, we said, 2 is equals to 20 divided by 6 times sigma, where the 20 is really the 260 minus the 240. We solve this equation for sigma, we do so, we cross multiply, and then we want to get that sigma is equal to 20 divided by 12. With that standard deviation, it's a six sigma process. That concludes the module on quality, as I said before, this module was less mathematical, and maybe even at times, somewhat philosophical. But for the better or for the worse, the complexity of real operations cannot always be squeezed into a set of elegant formulas. We're better off simply admitting that, and then we can iterate, we can prototype, we can experiment. Our models are still useful, we're not just randomly trying process improvement ideas out. Good theory in the form of good models will guide us where to look next. These models will help us formulate hypotheses, and they will guide us in their testing. With that approach, operations is as much as a science as physics or psychology. Thank you for your time.
