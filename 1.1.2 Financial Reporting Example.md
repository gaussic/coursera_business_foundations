布莱恩・布歇教授在课程中以戴夫的汽车运输服务公司为例讲解财务报表相关知识，主要内容如下：

### 背景介绍

2015 年 12 月 1 日，戴夫的公司开展了一系列初始业务，包括通过发行普通股筹资、向银行借款、购置卡车、预付办公场地租金等，12 月当月还有运输业务及工资支出等情况，12 月 31 日银行想通过财务报表了解公司该月是否盈利。

#### 现金流量表相关

- 初步查看现金流量：单纯按收支计算得出 8000 美元现金净流入，但此方法不适用于判断公司盈利状况，更好的做法是按经营、投资、融资活动区分现金流量。
- 按活动梳理现金流量情况：经营活动产生 22000 美元现金流出，投资活动因购买卡车有 100000 美元现金流出，融资活动则有 130000 美元净现金流入，最终整体现金余额为 8000 美元，同时介绍了现金流量表按不同活动呈现现金交易的构成形式。

#### 会计收益与利润表相关

- 会计收益要点：重点关注经营活动，即便未收到现金也可按业务情况确认收入，如运输业务应收款；对卡车、预付租金成本按使用期限等进行分摊列支，由此算出净利润，利润表遵循权责发生制呈现经营成果，收入、费用的确认关联经营活动而非现金流量。
- 两表对比：对比现金流量表与利润表，以收入、卡车成本、租金等为例，说明二者对相同业务呈现不同结果，经营活动现金流量体现实际现金进出，净利润侧重体现服务定价能否覆盖成本以及对未来现金状况的影响。

#### 资产负债表相关

- 资产情况：截至 2015 年 12 月 31 日，戴夫公司资产涵盖银行现金、应收账款、预付租金、卡车（考虑折旧后的价值）等，总计 157000 美元。
- 负债与股东权益情况：负债为欠银行的 80000 美元，股东权益包含普通股投资以及留存收益，留存收益与公司累计净利润和已支付股息有关，资产负债表具有平衡的特性。

### 原文及翻译

Hello, I'm Professor Brian Boucher andwelcome back. In this video, we're going to take a look at what the financial statements can tell us about a business. To do so, we're going to look at a very simple business with just a few transactions to see how those transactions would affect the required financial statements. I'm going to throw a lot of concepts at you in this video. But it's meant to be an overview. We're going to go through all these concepts again later on in the course. Let's get started. The example we're going to look at is Dave's Car Transport Service. So Dave starts a business to transport expensive cars. On December 1, 2015, he receives $50,000 cash from issuing common stock. He also borrows $80,000 from a bank. And we'll buy a $100,000 truck. The truck will be used for 48 months with a $4,000 salvage value.

大家好，我是布莱恩・布歇教授，欢迎回来。在本视频中，我们将了解一下财务报表能告诉我们关于一家企业的哪些信息。为此，我们要考察一家业务非常简单、仅有几笔交易的企业，看看这些交易将会如何影响所需编制的财务报表。在本视频中，我会向大家介绍很多概念，但这只是一个概述，我们在后续课程中还会再次详细讲解所有这些概念。让我们开始吧。我们要研究的例子是戴夫的汽车运输服务公司。2015 年 12 月 1 日，戴夫通过发行普通股筹集到了 50,000 美元现金。他还从银行借了 80,000 美元，并且购买了一辆价值 100,000 美元的卡车。这辆卡车预计可使用 48 个月，残值为 4,000 美元。

>> Excuse me, professor. What the lamb is salvage value? 
教授，打扰一下。残值到底是什么？

>> Just hold on a little bit, we'll get to that a little later. 
稍等一下，我们稍后就会讲到这个（内容）。

Dave also paid $12,000 cash upfront, to rent office space for the next year. During the month of December, Dave's company moves two cars the clients will pay them $40,000 within 30 days. Dave also pays his employees $10,000 of wages. Now it's December 31st and the bank wants to see some financial statements. 
戴夫还预付了 12,000 美元现金，用于租赁下一年的办公场地。在 12 月当月，戴夫的公司运送了两辆汽车，客户将在 30 天内支付他们 40,000 美元。戴夫还向员工支付了 10,000 美元的工资。现在到了 12 月 31 日，银行要求查看一些财务报表。

The bank wants to see financial statements because they want an answer to the question. Did the company make money during December? Now there's a number of different ways that we could try to answer this question. The first way would be to just look at all of the cash flows. So, if we take the facts and look at the cash flows, Dave's company received $50,000 cash from issuing stock, borrowed $80,000 from the bank, and bought $100,000 worth of truck. They paid $12,000 cash up front to rent office space for a year. 
银行想看财务报表，是因为他们想知道这样一个问题的答案：该公司在 12 月期间盈利了吗？现在，我们可以尝试用多种不同的方法来回答这个问题。第一种方法就是只查看所有的现金流量情况。那么，如果我们依据实际情况来查看现金流量，戴夫的公司通过发行股票收到了 50,000 美元现金，从银行借入了 80,000 美元，并且购买了价值 100,000 美元的卡车。他们预付了 12,000 美元现金用于租赁一年的办公场地。

They paid wages of $10,000 during December. And they did not collect any cash from customers during the month. So if we add it all up, they had a net cash inflow of $8,000. But as it turns out, this is a really bad way to figure out whether the company made money or not for December. 
他们在 12 月支付了 10,000 美元的工资。而且在这个月里，他们没有从客户那里收到任何现金。所以如果我们把这些全部加起来，他们有 8,000 美元的现金净流入。但事实证明，这是一种非常糟糕的用来判断该公司在 12 月是否盈利的方法。

>> Pardon me. What is wrong with that? Anytime I end the month with cash in the bank, it is a great month. 
请原谅，那样做（用这种方法判断）有什么问题呢？任何时候只要我在月底时银行账户里还有现金，那就是很棒的一个月呀。

>> Well, this is how a teenager would do accounting. You get an allowance from your parents. You borrow some money from your parents. You spend a bunch of money. If you end the month with money in the bank, it was a pretty good month. But this doesn't work so well for companies. All a company would have to do to post better performance into the system would be to borrow more money or sell more stock. A better way to look at cash flows would be to separate them into whether they come from operating the business or investing for the future, or financing for the long term. 
嗯，这是青少年会采用的记账方式。你从父母那儿拿到零花钱，又从父母那儿借了些钱，然后花出去一大笔钱。要是到了月底银行账户里还有钱，那这个月就算过得挺不错了。但对于公司来说，这种方式可不太好用。一家公司要是想在账面上呈现出更好的业绩，只需借更多的钱或者增发更多的股票就行了。更好的查看现金流量的方法是，将它们区分为是来自企业经营活动、为未来进行的投资活动，还是出于长期目的的融资活动产生的现金流量。

Let's try organizing the cash flows by the source or use of the cash. So let's start with cash flows from operating the business. This would be cash that was paid for the rent. The cash that it was payed for the wages. We didn't actually collect anything from customers, so the net casual from operating the business was a cash outflow of $22,000. Then we can look at cash required to invest in the business for the long-term. So the company spend $100,000 cash to buy a truck, which resulted in a total cash outflow from investing activities of $100,000. And then finally, we can look at cash used to finance the business. So, the company received $50,000 in cash from issuing common stock. They borrowed $80,000 from a bank, which was a net cash inflow from financing activities of $130,000. We still get the same bottom line of $8,000. But now, we've organized the cash flows based on whether we're operating the business, investing in the business, or financing the business. And this is exactly what the statement of cash flows will look like. It's going to report the cash transactions for the company over a period of time like the month of December. Split up into operating activities which are transactions related to providing goods or services or other normal business activities. Investing activities, which are transactions related to the acquisition or disposal of long-lived assets. And financing activities, which are transactions related to owners or creditors. 
让我们试着按照现金的来源或用途来梳理现金流量。那我们先从经营活动产生的现金流量开始说起。这部分现金流量包括支付租金的现金以及支付工资的现金。实际上我们并没有从客户那里收到任何款项，所以经营活动产生的净现金流量是 22,000 美元的现金流出。接着，我们可以看看为企业进行长期投资所需的现金情况。该公司花了 100,000 美元现金购买了一辆卡车，这就导致投资活动产生了总计 100,000 美元的现金流出。最后，我们可以看看用于企业融资的现金情况。该公司通过发行普通股筹集到了 50,000 美元现金，还从银行借入了 80,000 美元，这样融资活动就产生了 130,000 美元的净现金流入。我们最终得到的结果还是 8,000 美元这个底线金额。但现在，我们已经按照是经营业务、投资业务还是为业务融资的不同情况对现金流量进行了梳理。而这正是现金流量表呈现的样子。它会报告公司在一段时期内（比如 12 月这个月）的现金交易情况，细分为经营活动（即与提供商品、服务或其他常规经营活动相关的交易）、投资活动（即与购置或处置长期资产相关的交易）以及融资活动（即与所有者或债权人相关的交易）。

Another way to try to answer the question of whether the company made money in December, is to look at accounting income. Accounting income tries to look at business activities rather than cash going in or out. For example, we actually did move two cars during December. Even though we haven't got paid cash yet, we're likely to get paid cash, so why not book revenue of $40,000 to recognize the cash that we'll eventually get, from providing the service of moving the cars. 
另一种尝试回答该公司在 12 月是否盈利这一问题的方法，是查看会计收益。会计收益着眼于经营活动，而非现金的流入或流出情况。例如，我们在 12 月确实运送了两辆汽车。尽管我们目前还没有收到现金，但我们很有可能会收到这笔钱，那么为何不将 40,000 美元记为收入，以确认我们最终因提供汽车运输服务而将会收到的这笔现金呢。

Even though we paid $100,000 for a truck, we're going to use that truck over four years. So why not allocate the cost of the truck over the four years. So we have a $100,000 truck with a $4,000 salvage value. Salvage value is how much we think the truck will be worth when we're done with it. So let's take that $96,000 of value that we're going to use up, divide it by 48 months. And recognize a $2,000 expensive of using the truck, each of the next 48 months. We paid $12,000 cash upfront to rent office space for a year, but we've only been in there for one month. So why not just show one month of expense $1,000, rather than the full $12,000 of cash that we paid up front. We paid $10,000 of cash to employees for wages. That was all due to work they provided this month, so we'll show that all as a wages expense. That gives us something called net income. Net income is a measure of whether we priced our service, moving cars, high enough to cover all of the costs or expenses of running the business, all of the cost of moving the cars. 
尽管我们花了 100,000 美元购买了一辆卡车，但我们打算在四年内使用这辆卡车。那么，为何不将卡车的成本分摊到这四年里呢？我们有一辆价值 100,000 美元的卡车，残值为 4,000 美元。残值就是我们认为在使用完这辆卡车后它还能值多少钱。那我们就用将要损耗的 96,000 美元价值（100,000 美元减去 4,000 美元）除以 48 个月，然后在接下来的 48 个月里，每个月确认 2,000 美元的卡车使用费用。 我们预付了 12,000 美元现金用于租赁一年的办公场地，但我们目前只使用了一个月。那么，为何不只列支一个月的费用，也就是 1,000 美元，而不是我们预付的全部 12,000 美元现金呢。 我们向员工支付了 10,000 美元现金作为工资。这都是因为他们在本月提供了劳动，所以我们会把这些全部列为工资费用。 这样我们就得到了一个叫做净利润的指标。净利润是衡量我们为汽车运输服务定价是否足够高，能否覆盖运营企业的所有成本或费用，也就是能否覆盖汽车运输的所有成本的一个指标。

And this is what the income statement is going to tell us. It is going to give us the results of operations over a period of time, using this notion of accrual accounting, where recognition is tied to business activities, not to cash flows. We'll have revenues, which are increases in owners' equity from providing goods or services. And we'll talk more about what owners' equity is in a little bit. We'll have expenses, which are decreases in owners' equity, which are incurred in the process of generating these revenues. It's the cost of doing business. The bottom line or the differences between revenue and expenses is going to be called net income, which is also called earnings or net profit. And it's important to note that it does not equal the change in cash because it's a measure based upon business activities, not purely cash flow. 
而这正是利润表将要告诉我们的内容。它会运用权责发生制会计这一概念，向我们呈现一段时期内的经营成果，在权责发生制下，确认（收入、费用等）是与经营活动相关联的，而非与现金流量相关联。 我们会有收入这一项，它指的是因提供商品或服务而带来的所有者权益的增加。稍后我们会再多讲讲所有者权益是什么。我们还会有费用这一项，它是在产生这些收入的过程中所发生的、导致所有者权益减少的项目，也就是经营成本。 最下面一行，也就是收入与费用之间的差额，将会被称为净利润，它也被称作收益或纯利润。需要注意的是，它并不等同于现金的变动，因为它是一项基于经营活动的衡量指标，并非纯粹基于现金流量。

>> This does not make any sense. How can we record revenue without getting any cash? What is this depreciation stuff? We didn't spend $2,000 on a truck, we spent $100,000. 
这根本说不通啊。我们都还没收到现金，怎么能记收入呢？这个折旧是怎么回事呀？我们买卡车花的是 100,000 美元，又不是 2,000 美元。

>> Okay, just give me a few videos. It'll, it'll take a little bit to explain all this to you. Just, hang in there.
好的，再给我几个视频的时间吧。要把这一切都给你们解释清楚得花点儿时间呢。坚持一下啊。

>> Fine. There are two different statements for this month's results. Which one is better? Which should we use? 
好吧。对于这个月的经营成果有两种不同的报表。哪一种更好呢？我们该用哪一种呢？

>> I once heard that Cash is King. I am going to only use the Cash Flow Statement. 
我曾听说 “现金为王”。我打算只用现金流量表。

>> No, no, no, no, no. We'll talk about this more. But you definitely want to use both statements because they tell you different things. 
不不不不不。我们之后会对此再多做些讲解。但你肯定是两种报表都要用的，因为它们反映的是不同方面的情况。

Let's take a look at how these two statements provide different pictures of what happened with the company. So starting with revenue, that tells you that you moved cars during the period and you are eventually going to get paid $40,000 from customers. Where as the $0 in the cash flow statement says that you actually didn't get any cash this period. 
让我们来看一看这两份报表是如何针对公司所发生的情况展现出不同图景的。首先从收入说起，收入这一项表明在这一期间你运送了汽车，而且最终你将会从客户那里收到 40,000 美元款项。然而现金流量表中显示的 0 美元则意味着在这个期间你实际上并没有收到任何现金。

For the truck, the cashless statement tells you, you spend a $100,000 cash on a truck. The accounting income says that the cost of the truck used up this period to generate revenue, is only $2,000. Because we're spreading it over the whole time that we're going to use the truck. 
对于卡车这一项来说，现金流量表显示你花了 100,000 美元现金购买了一辆卡车。而会计收益（利润表）显示，本期为产生收入而耗用的卡车成本仅为 2,000 美元，因为我们是将其成本分摊到卡车的整个使用期限内的。

For rent, our cashless statement said we paid $12,000 cash this period for rent. But our accounting income says that we only used up one month of that. We still have $11,000 that we haven't used up, that we'll use up over the next 11 months. Sometimes the expenses and the cash flow are the same as in the case of wages here. But as you can see from the cash from operations and net income, you're getting very different pictures. Cashflow from operations of negative 22,000 says that you spent more cash than you had come in based on these operating activities. The net income though. Says that you priced your service high enough to cover all the costs of providing the service. Which even though it didn't get you cash this period should lead to positive cash flow in the future. 
关于租金，我们的现金流量表显示本期我们支付了 12,000 美元现金作为租金。但我们的会计收益（利润表）显示，我们本期只耗用了其中一个月的租金，我们还有 11,000 美元尚未耗用，这部分会在接下来的 11 个月里陆续耗用。有时候，费用和现金流量是一致的，就像这里的工资情况一样。但正如你从经营活动现金流量和净利润中看到的那样，它们呈现出的情况截然不同。经营活动现金流量为负 22,000 美元，这表明基于这些经营活动，你支出的现金比流入的现金要多。然而，净利润显示你为服务所定的价格足够高，足以覆盖提供该项服务的所有成本，尽管本期这并没有让你收到现金，但在未来应该会带来正向的现金流量。

The next statement that we're going to preview is the balance sheet which provides the financial position of Dave's Car Transport Company at the end of the month. 
我们接下来要预览的报表是资产负债表，它展示的是戴夫的汽车运输公司在月末时的财务状况。

By financial position we mean all their resources and obligations. So the resources are what we call assets, so what are the assets or resources of Dave's company? Well they have $8,000 cash in the bank at, December, 31 2015. They have something called an accounts receivable of $40,000. That's the cash owed by customers on December 31st. And that's an asset because it's going to eventually turn into cash when you collect from the customers. 
说到财务状况，我们指的是公司的所有资源和债务情况。所谓资源，就是我们所说的资产，那么戴夫的公司有哪些资产或者说资源呢？嗯，在 2015 年 12 月 31 日，他们银行账户里有 8,000 美元现金。他们还有一项叫做应收账款的资产，金额为 40,000 美元。这是截至 12 月 31 日客户所欠的款项，它属于资产，因为当你从客户那里收回款项时，它最终会转化为现金。

Another asset is prepaid rent. Remember that Dave paid $12,000 for a years of rent. One month has been used up, but they still have 11 months of prepaid rent. This is an asset because they can occupy the space for another 11 months, without paying any additional cash. And then, of course, there's the truck, which is an asset of $98,000. That's the original cost of $100,000 minus that $2,000 that we depreciated. And we'll talk more about this later on. So that gives us total assets or resources of $157,000. 
另一项资产是预付租金。还记得戴夫支付了 12,000 美元用于一年的租金吧。虽然已经耗用了一个月，但他们仍有 11 个月的预付租金。这属于一项资产，因为他们还能再使用这个场地 11 个月，而无需额外支付现金。然后，当然了，还有那辆卡车，它作为一项资产，价值 98,000 美元，也就是其原始成本 100,000 美元减去我们已计提的 2,000 美元折旧额。我们稍后会对此再多做些讲解。这样算下来，我们总的资产，也就是资源，共计 157,000 美元。

Now we can look at all the obligations or claims on these resources which are the liabilities and stockholder's equity. Dave owes the bank $80,000 at December 31, 2015. That's a liability called bank debt. There's $50,000 of stockholder's investment as of December 31. This is a stockholder's equity called common stock. And then there are retained earnings of $27,000. Retained earnings represent all of the net income or accounting income that's been created over the life of the company, minus any dividends that have been paid out, which we'll talk about later. And when we add it all up, the obligations are the same as the resources of $157,000. And this is characteristic of the balance sheet which always has to balance, hence the name. 
现在我们可以看看针对这些资源的所有债务或权益主张，也就是负债和股东权益。在 2015 年 12 月 31 日，戴夫欠银行 80,000 美元。这是一项被称作银行债务的负债。截至 12 月 31 日，有股东投资 50,000 美元，这属于股东权益中的普通股。然后还有留存收益 27,000 美元。留存收益代表的是公司自成立以来所创造的全部净利润，也就是会计收益，减去已支付的任何股息（我们稍后会对此进行讨论）之后的金额。当我们把这些全部加起来时，负债与股东权益之和与资产总额一样，都是 157,000 美元。这就是资产负债表的特点，它总是要保持平衡，资产负债表的名称也正源于此。

>> I am truly lost. When is this video going to end? 
我真的完全糊涂了。这个视频什么时候才能结束啊？

>> I'm sorry. I know I've thrown a lot of new concepts at you in this video. But don't worry, we're going to go over everything again in more detail. So just hang in there. And there's only a couple more slides, and we're done. 
很抱歉。我知道在这个视频里我向你们灌输了很多新概念。不过别担心，我们会更详细地把所有内容再梳理一遍的。所以坚持一下吧。而且只剩下几张幻灯片了，之后就结束了。

So as I was saying, this financial statement is called the balance sheet. It's going to report the financial position of the company. Its resources and obligations on a specific date. We've got assets, which are resources owned by the business, that are expected to provide future economic benefits. Liabilities are claims on those assets by creditors, or non owners. Creditors, that represent an obligation to make future payments of cash, goods, or services. Stockholder's equity, or owners' equity, are claims on the assets by the owners of the business. Those come from two sources, contributed capital, which arise when you sell shares, and retained earnings, which arise when you operate the business. We're going to talk about these a lot more in the next few videos. The last statement is the Statement of Stockholders' Equity. And we're going to get to this later. 
就像我刚才说的，这份财务报表被称作资产负债表。它会报告公司在特定日期的财务状况，也就是公司的资源和债务情况。我们有资产这一项，资产是企业所拥有的资源，预期能为企业带来未来的经济利益。负债是债权人（非企业所有者）对这些资产的权益主张，债权人代表着企业有义务在未来支付现金、交付货物或提供服务。股东权益，或者说所有者权益，是企业所有者对资产的权益主张。这些权益来自两个方面，一是投入资本，它产生于企业发售股票之时；二是留存收益，它产生于企业经营过程中。在接下来的几个视频里，我们会更深入地探讨这些内容。最后一份报表是股东权益变动表。我们稍后会讲到它。

Hopefully, that gave you a good overview of what the financial statements are trying to tell us. We are now going to start looking at the financial statements in more detail, starting in the next video with the balance sheet and the balance sheet equation. I'll see you then. 
希望这能让你对财务报表想要传达给我们的信息有一个很好的概览。接下来，我们要开始更详细地研究财务报表了，在下一个视频中，我们将从资产负债表以及资产负债表等式入手。到时候再见啦。

>> See you next video.
下个视频见。
