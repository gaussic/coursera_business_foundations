## Coursera 商业基础课程《企业财务导论》 - 模块4 - 投资回报

### 课程4.1 决策标准

通过贴现现金流（DCF）分析，结合多种决策标准（NPV、IRR、投资回收期）评估项目的投资回报，并强调敏感性分析的重要性，帮助学员理解如何基于财务模型做出投资决策。


#### 1. 关键概念与结论

##### 1. 净现值（NPV）

- **定义**：项目未来自由现金流的现值减去初始投资，反映项目对企业的价值贡献。
- **计算**：  
  \[
  NPV = \sum \frac{自由现金流}{(1 + 折现率)^t} - 初始投资
  \]
  - 示例中假设折现率 \( R = 12\% \)，计算得平板项目 \( NPV = 7.0842 \) 亿美元。
- **决策规则**：  
  - **接受正NPV项目**（增加企业价值），拒绝负NPV项目。
  - **优势**：直接量化价值创造，考虑时间价值和风险。
  - **局限性**：依赖折现率准确性，需结合敏感性分析（如折现率变化对NPV的影响）。

##### 2. 内部收益率（IRR）

- **定义**：使项目NPV为零的折现率，反映项目的预期回报率。
- **计算**：通过数值方法（Excel的`IRR`函数或试错法）求解。示例中平板项目IRR为43.7%。
- **决策规则**：  
  - 若IRR > 资本成本（折现率），接受项目。
  - **优势**：直观反映回报率，便于与资本成本比较。
  - **局限性**：  
    - 忽略项目规模（高IRR但小规模项目可能不如低IRR大项目有价值）。
    - 多重IRR问题（现金流方向多次变化时可能有多个解）。
    - 与NPV冲突时，**NPV优先**（因NPV直接衡量价值创造）。

#### 3. 投资回收期（Payback Period）
- **定义**：累计自由现金流由负转正所需时间，衡量投资回收速度。
  - **普通回收期**：示例中项目3年回收初始投资。
  - **贴现回收期**：考虑资金时间价值，示例中贴现后需4年。
- **决策规则**：  
  - 若回收期短于阈值，接受项目。
  - **优势**：简单易懂，关注流动性风险。
  - **局限性**：  
    - 忽略回收期后的现金流（如忽略第5年巨额现金流）。
    - 未量化价值影响，无法比较同类回收期项目。

#### 2. 综合对比与关键结论

##### 1. NPV为黄金标准 

- 唯一直接衡量价值创造的指标，应作为核心决策依据。
- 需结合敏感性分析（如绘制NPV-折现率曲线），评估假设变动对结果的稳健性。  
  - 示例中即使折现率升至20%，NPV仍为正，显示项目抗风险能力强。

##### 2. IRR与回收期的辅助作用

- IRR帮助理解回报率，但需警惕其局限性（如忽略规模、多重解问题）。
- 回收期适合评估流动性风险，但需补充贴现回收期以减少时间价值偏差。

##### 3. 敏感性分析的重要性

- 资本成本估算存在误差时，需测试NPV对折现率的敏感度（如图表中IRR与折现率的差距）。
- 示例中IRR（43.7%）远高于资本成本（12%），显示项目对折现率误差容忍度高。

#### 3. 实际应用建议

- **优先使用NPV**：结合贴现现金流分析，验证项目价值。
- **辅助工具选择**：  
  - 用Excel的`NPV`、`IRR`函数或「单变量求解」工具简化计算。
  - 绘制NPV曲线（横轴为折现率）直观评估项目风险容错空间。
- **避免短视决策**：即使回收期较短，仍需关注长期现金流（如项目末期的高收益）。

#### 总结

NPV是投资决策的核心工具，IRR和回收期提供补充视角，但需谨慎其局限性。通过敏感性分析验证假设的稳健性，是确保决策科学性的关键步骤。

## 模块标题: Week 4: Return on Investment

引言: 

This module closes out our discussion of discounted cash flow analysis and caps off the course with a discussion of return on investment. By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable with the notion of free cash flow and the ability to apply a set of forecast drivers to project free cash flows into the future. These are some of the elements of a basic financial model, which we will use to come to a decision about the tablet project and to analyze the assumptions behind our valuation.

### 第一章: Return on Investment

#### 视频小节1: Decision Criteria

字幕文本: 

Welcome back to corporate finance. Last time we applied our forecast drivers to our free cash flow formula to forecast free cash flows for our tablet project. Today I want to take those free cash flows and apply our different decision criteria to come up with decisions regarding our project. Let's get started.

Hi everyone. Welcome back to corporate finance. Today we're going to talk about decision criteria, but before doing so, let's recap our previous lecture in which we forecasted free cash flows. Specifically we took our forecast drivers, our assumptions about what would happen in the future and applied them to generate dollar forecasts of all of the components of the free cash flow formula, which we then built up, aggregated into free cash flow forecasts. Today we're going to turn to what to do with those forecasts, by looking at different decision criteria. So let's get started.

So what do we do with our cash flows from last time? One thing we can do is we can compute the NPV. And I'm going to assume a discount rate of 12%. That is R equals 12%. And if we do that and apply it to our free cash flows that we computed in the last lecture, what we're going to see that this project, this tablet project has an NPV of $708.42 million. Not bad. What that means is that firm value, debt plus equity, is going to increase by $708.42 million in expectation if the project is undertaken.

So from a decision-making standpoint, undertake the project.

That's what the NPV Rule tells us. It says accept all projects with a positive NPV, reject all projects with a negative NPV.

And while this has boiled it down to one number, I want to be careful especially when we start doing our sensitivity analysis to recognize that we don't want to pin all our hopes to that one number.

Now another thing we can do is you can compute the internal rate of return. The internal rate of return of a project, recall, is the one discount rate such that the net present value of the project's free cash flows equals zero. We've actually already seen this when we were talking about yields. Remember the yield is the one discount rate such that when you discount the cash flows by the yield, you get the price. But the MPV is nothing more than the price minus the present value of all the future cash flows, okay? So IRR and yield are really one in the same.

So what's the IRR for this project? Well we write our NPV formula, we set our NPV equal to 0, and then we solve for the one discount rate such that when we discount all of our free cash flows, we get an NPV of 0. If we do that, we find that the IRR on this project is 43.7%. Well, is that good? Is it bad? Before getting there, I just want to mention, typically we're going to need to solve this numerically, unless you've figured out some amazing way to solve higher order polynomials. You can use the IRR function in Excel. I think you can use the use GOAL SEEK in Excel. You can try trial and error, though that's really inefficient. If you're using another software program or a financial calculator, you can do this as well. All right. So what do we do with this 43.7% IRR? Well, we're going to compare it to our cost of capital, our hurdle rate. And what we're going to do is we're doing to undertake the project because the IRR is greater than the hurdle rate. Intuitively, it makes sense. And this is one of those cases where intuition actually works. It costs us 12% to raise money in the capital markets, to fund our investments, to create value. If this project generates a return of 43.7%, that's substantially larger than what it cost us to raise the funds. That sounds good. That makes sense. And so what the IRR Rule says is accept all projects whose IRR is greater than R, and reject all projects whose IRR is less than R, where R is our hurdle rate. Hurdle rate cost of capital our discount rate.

Now I do mention the IRR Rule is informative. It's also somewhat intuitive and appeals a lot to investors who tend to think in terms of returns, but it's got a number of shortcomings that we're going to explore in greater detail in Topic 4, Return on Investment. Now one picture I'd like to show you is the following. I've plotted the cost of capital on the horizontal axis and the project NPV on the vertical axis. And what the blue line shows is it shows how the NPV of the project varies as I vary the cost of capital. Two points are worth noting. First is this point right here, which is the 12% cost of capital of the project. You'll notice that generates an NPV, as we saw earlier, of a little bit over $700 million. The second point I want to point out is this point, the point where the graph crosses the x-axis. That's the point at which the NPV is 0, which as we know from our definition earlier, is just the IRR. That's 43.7%. Now I think this graph is, let me clear this up a little bit, this graph is useful because from a sensitivity analysis or robustness perspective. Look, this R is an estimate and to be honest with you, it's typically a noisy one.

What I see here is I see a really wide gap between my estimated cost of capital and the point at which this project just breaks even. So even if we disagree on the cost of capital and you're taking a more conservative view, and you think it's up, or the real cost of capital is 20%, that's okay. This project is still NPV positive. It's still value accretive. And so what this gap here shows is it shows that I’ve got a lot of room for error, at least on the discount rate dimension.

The third thing we can do with our cash flows, our free cash flows, is compute a payback period, which is the duration or the time until the cumulative free cash flows turn positive. So lets look at our project. Here are our free cash flows. I'm going to accumulate them year over year so this negative 510.4 is just the 376.8 in Year 0 plus the negative 133.6 in Year 1 and on and on for years 2 through 5. And then I'm going to look at the cumulative free cash flows and ask when do they turn positive? Well, they turn positive right here in year 3, so our payback period is year 3. We turn cash flow positive in year 3. Some people might say it takes three years to recover your investment. Is that good? Is it bad? How do we know if three is good? How does that help us in our decision of whether or not to undertake the project? Well, what we do is we compare it to some threshold. And so the payback period rule, it says accept all projects with payback periods less than the threshold, reject all projects with payback periods greater than that threshold.

But, it should be immediately clear that the Payback Rule or the Payback Period Rule has several shortcomings. The first of which, it's ignoring the time value of money and risk of cash flows, the first sin that we learned way back at the start of the course. But fortunately that's actually quite easy to deal with. We can compute the discounted payback period by discounting the free cash flows, right? The discounted payback period of a project is just the duration until the cumulative discounted free cash flows turn positive. And so on this slide, I've computed those discounted free cash flows using our cost of capital of 12%. And then I cumulate them and wait or count until they turn positive which is right here in year 4. So our discounted payback period if 4, which is greater than our payback period of 3.

But even using the discounted payback period, this rule has a number of shortcomings. For example, it ignores cash flows after the cutoff and that's going to lead to myopic decision making. Let me go back a slide. What if this cash flow in year 5, was $20 billion? Well $20,114,000,000. It'd be a shame to ignore that and the implication for that of that cash flow.

So by ignoring those cash flows, you get myopic decision making. Number two, it's not telling us the value implications of our decision, right? It's not helping us quantify the effects of any decision that we make. It's also not helpful in choosing among projects with similar payback periods. So I've got three projects, they all have payback periods of four. Which one do I choose if I can only choose one?

All right, so let's bring this all back together. Let's bring it full circle. So there's several decision criteria. NPV is unambiguously the best and should always be used, but I want to emphasize that others, such as the internal rate of return and payback period or its discounted cousin, they're all informative. And the key is to understand the shortcomings of these alternative decision criteria to avoid any mistakes that feed into the ultimate decision. So what I want to turn to in our next class is sensitivity analysis, which is an integral component of any DCF. Thanks again and I look forward to seeing you.
