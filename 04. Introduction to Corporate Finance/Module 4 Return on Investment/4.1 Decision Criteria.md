### 视频总结：Week 4 - 投资回报（Return on Investment）

#### **核心概念**
1. **决策准则（Decision Criteria）**  
   • **净现值（NPV）**：基于自由现金流（FCF）和贴现率（如12%）计算，衡量项目创造的价值。  
     ◦ **公式**：  
       \[
       \text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^T \frac{\text{FCF}_t}{(1+R)^t}
       \]
     ◦ **决策规则**：接受NPV>0的项目（如案例中NPV为7.08亿美元）。  
   • **内部收益率（IRR）**：使NPV=0的贴现率（案例中IRR为43.7%）。  
     ◦ **决策规则**：若IRR > 资本成本（Hurdle Rate），则接受项目。  
   • **回收期法（Payback Period）**：累计现金流转正所需时间（案例中为3年）。  
     ◦ **折现回收期法**：考虑时间价值后的回收期（案例中为4年）。  

2. **决策准则的对比与局限性**  
   • **NPV的优势**：直接量化价值创造，考虑所有现金流的时间价值和风险。  
   • **IRR的缺陷**：  
     ◦ 多重解问题（非传统现金流可能出现多个IRR）。  
     ◦ 再投资假设不现实（假设项目收益以IRR再投资）。  
   • **回收期法的短视性**：忽略回收期后的现金流，可能导致拒绝长期高收益项目。  

3. **敏感性分析与稳健性**  
   • **NPV与资本成本关系图**：展示NPV随贴现率变化的曲线，IRR为曲线与横轴交点。  
   • **误差容忍度**：案例中资本成本（12%）与IRR（43.7%）差距大，显示项目对贴现率假设的强稳健性。

#### **关键结论**
1. **NPV为首选决策标准**  
   • **唯一性**：NPV直接反映股东价值增量，避免其他方法的假设偏差。  
   • **实践优先级**：即使IRR和回收期法提供补充信息，NPV仍为最终决策依据。

2. **IRR的辅助作用与风险**  
   • **直观吸引力**：IRR以百分比形式展示回报率，易与资本成本对比。  
   • **使用限制**：需警惕与传统NPV结论冲突的情况（如项目规模差异或现金流模式复杂时）。

3. **回收期法的实用场景与缺陷**  
   • **流动性评估**：回收期法适合评估短期流动性风险（如初创企业关注快速回本）。  
   • **忽略长期价值**：若项目后期现金流巨大（如案例第5年$201亿），回收期法可能导致错误拒绝。

4. **多准则综合决策的必要性**  
   • **互补信息**：IRR反映收益率，回收期法评估流动性，NPV量化价值。  
   • **企业实践**：CFO调查显示，企业常结合NPV、IRR和回收期法，平衡长期价值与短期风险。

#### **实际应用示例**
• **平板项目决策（案例）**：  
  • **NPV计算**：贴现率12%下，NPV=7.08亿美元 → 接受项目。  
  • **IRR验证**：43.7% > 12%，进一步支持接受决策。  
  • **回收期参考**：3年回收期低于行业阈值（如科技产品通常接受5年内回收）。  

• **敏感性分析**：  
  • 若资本成本升至20%，NPV仍为正（图表显示NPV曲线平缓，容忍高贴现率）。  
  • 若第5年现金流降至$50亿，NPV≈3.2亿美元，仍保持正收益。

---

#### **下一步学习方向**
后续课程将深入**敏感性分析**，探讨如何调整关键假设（如市场规模、成本结构）以评估项目风险。重点包括：  
1. 构建最佳/最差情景模拟，量化关键变量（如增长率、定价）对NPV的影响。  
2. 识别“价值驱动因素”（如市场份额或研发效率），优化资源配置。  
3. 结合蒙特卡洛模拟，量化多变量联动下的项目风险概率分布。

## 模块标题: Week 4: Return on Investment

引言: 

This module closes out our discussion of discounted cash flow analysis and caps off the course with a discussion of return on investment. By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable with the notion of free cash flow and the ability to apply a set of forecast drivers to project free cash flows into the future. These are some of the elements of a basic financial model, which we will use to come to a decision about the tablet project and to analyze the assumptions behind our valuation.

### 第一章: Return on Investment

#### 视频小节1: Decision Criteria

字幕文本: 

Welcome back to corporate finance. Last time we applied our forecast drivers to our free cash flow formula to forecast free cash flows for our tablet project. Today I want to take those free cash flows and apply our different decision criteria to come up with decisions regarding our project. Let's get started.

Hi everyone. Welcome back to corporate finance. Today we're going to talk about decision criteria, but before doing so, let's recap our previous lecture in which we forecasted free cash flows. Specifically we took our forecast drivers, our assumptions about what would happen in the future and applied them to generate dollar forecasts of all of the components of the free cash flow formula, which we then built up, aggregated into free cash flow forecasts. Today we're going to turn to what to do with those forecasts, by looking at different decision criteria. So let's get started.

So what do we do with our cash flows from last time? One thing we can do is we can compute the NPV. And I'm going to assume a discount rate of 12%. That is R equals 12%. And if we do that and apply it to our free cash flows that we computed in the last lecture, what we're going to see that this project, this tablet project has an NPV of $708.42 million. Not bad. What that means is that firm value, debt plus equity, is going to increase by $708.42 million in expectation if the project is undertaken.

So from a decision-making standpoint, undertake the project.

That's what the NPV Rule tells us. It says accept all projects with a positive NPV, reject all projects with a negative NPV.

And while this has boiled it down to one number, I want to be careful especially when we start doing our sensitivity analysis to recognize that we don't want to pin all our hopes to that one number.

Now another thing we can do is you can compute the internal rate of return. The internal rate of return of a project, recall, is the one discount rate such that the net present value of the project's free cash flows equals zero. We've actually already seen this when we were talking about yields. Remember the yield is the one discount rate such that when you discount the cash flows by the yield, you get the price. But the MPV is nothing more than the price minus the present value of all the future cash flows, okay? So IRR and yield are really one in the same.

So what's the IRR for this project? Well we write our NPV formula, we set our NPV equal to 0, and then we solve for the one discount rate such that when we discount all of our free cash flows, we get an NPV of 0. If we do that, we find that the IRR on this project is 43.7%. Well, is that good? Is it bad? Before getting there, I just want to mention, typically we're going to need to solve this numerically, unless you've figured out some amazing way to solve higher order polynomials. You can use the IRR function in Excel. I think you can use the use GOAL SEEK in Excel. You can try trial and error, though that's really inefficient. If you're using another software program or a financial calculator, you can do this as well. All right. So what do we do with this 43.7% IRR? Well, we're going to compare it to our cost of capital, our hurdle rate. And what we're going to do is we're doing to undertake the project because the IRR is greater than the hurdle rate. Intuitively, it makes sense. And this is one of those cases where intuition actually works. It costs us 12% to raise money in the capital markets, to fund our investments, to create value. If this project generates a return of 43.7%, that's substantially larger than what it cost us to raise the funds. That sounds good. That makes sense. And so what the IRR Rule says is accept all projects whose IRR is greater than R, and reject all projects whose IRR is less than R, where R is our hurdle rate. Hurdle rate cost of capital our discount rate.

Now I do mention the IRR Rule is informative. It's also somewhat intuitive and appeals a lot to investors who tend to think in terms of returns, but it's got a number of shortcomings that we're going to explore in greater detail in Topic 4, Return on Investment. Now one picture I'd like to show you is the following. I've plotted the cost of capital on the horizontal axis and the project NPV on the vertical axis. And what the blue line shows is it shows how the NPV of the project varies as I vary the cost of capital. Two points are worth noting. First is this point right here, which is the 12% cost of capital of the project. You'll notice that generates an NPV, as we saw earlier, of a little bit over $700 million. The second point I want to point out is this point, the point where the graph crosses the x-axis. That's the point at which the NPV is 0, which as we know from our definition earlier, is just the IRR. That's 43.7%. Now I think this graph is, let me clear this up a little bit, this graph is useful because from a sensitivity analysis or robustness perspective. Look, this R is an estimate and to be honest with you, it's typically a noisy one.

What I see here is I see a really wide gap between my estimated cost of capital and the point at which this project just breaks even. So even if we disagree on the cost of capital and you're taking a more conservative view, and you think it's up, or the real cost of capital is 20%, that's okay. This project is still NPV positive. It's still value accretive. And so what this gap here shows is it shows that I’ve got a lot of room for error, at least on the discount rate dimension.

The third thing we can do with our cash flows, our free cash flows, is compute a payback period, which is the duration or the time until the cumulative free cash flows turn positive. So lets look at our project. Here are our free cash flows. I'm going to accumulate them year over year so this negative 510.4 is just the 376.8 in Year 0 plus the negative 133.6 in Year 1 and on and on for years 2 through 5. And then I'm going to look at the cumulative free cash flows and ask when do they turn positive? Well, they turn positive right here in year 3, so our payback period is year 3. We turn cash flow positive in year 3. Some people might say it takes three years to recover your investment. Is that good? Is it bad? How do we know if three is good? How does that help us in our decision of whether or not to undertake the project? Well, what we do is we compare it to some threshold. And so the payback period rule, it says accept all projects with payback periods less than the threshold, reject all projects with payback periods greater than that threshold.

But, it should be immediately clear that the Payback Rule or the Payback Period Rule has several shortcomings. The first of which, it's ignoring the time value of money and risk of cash flows, the first sin that we learned way back at the start of the course. But fortunately that's actually quite easy to deal with. We can compute the discounted payback period by discounting the free cash flows, right? The discounted payback period of a project is just the duration until the cumulative discounted free cash flows turn positive. And so on this slide, I've computed those discounted free cash flows using our cost of capital of 12%. And then I cumulate them and wait or count until they turn positive which is right here in year 4. So our discounted payback period if 4, which is greater than our payback period of 3.

But even using the discounted payback period, this rule has a number of shortcomings. For example, it ignores cash flows after the cutoff and that's going to lead to myopic decision making. Let me go back a slide. What if this cash flow in year 5, was $20 billion? Well $20,114,000,000. It'd be a shame to ignore that and the implication for that of that cash flow.

So by ignoring those cash flows, you get myopic decision making. Number two, it's not telling us the value implications of our decision, right? It's not helping us quantify the effects of any decision that we make. It's also not helpful in choosing among projects with similar payback periods. So I've got three projects, they all have payback periods of four. Which one do I choose if I can only choose one?

All right, so let's bring this all back together. Let's bring it full circle. So there's several decision criteria. NPV is unambiguously the best and should always be used, but I want to emphasize that others, such as the internal rate of return and payback period or its discounted cousin, they're all informative. And the key is to understand the shortcomings of these alternative decision criteria to avoid any mistakes that feed into the ultimate decision. So what I want to turn to in our next class is sensitivity analysis, which is an integral component of any DCF. Thanks again and I look forward to seeing you.
