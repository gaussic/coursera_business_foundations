### 课程1.4 税收影响

#### 1. 核心概念
1. **税收对投资回报的影响**  
   1. 税收通过减少利息收入或资本利得的实际收益，降低投资的**税后回报率**，进而影响现金流现值和未来值。  
   2. **关键公式**：税后贴现率（\( R_t \)）计算：  
     \[
     R_t = R \times (1 - t)
     \]
     其中，\( R \) 为税前贴现率，\( t \) 为税率。

2. **税后现金流的动态调整**  
   1. 税收导致可用资金减少，需增加初始储蓄或调整现金流以满足目标提款需求。

#### 2. 关键规则与操作

1. **税后贴现率的使用**  
   1. 在计算现值或未来值时，需将税前贴现率调整为税后贴现率。  
   2. **步骤**：  
      1. 确定税前贴现率（\( R \)）及税率（\( t \)）。  
      2. 计算税后贴现率：\( R_t = R \times (1 - t) \)。  
      3. 使用 \( R_t \) 进行现金流折现或复利计算。

2. **税收对储蓄需求的影响**  
   1. 税收减少投资的实际收益，需存入更多初始资金以维持相同的提款计划（见下文实例）。

#### 3. 实例应用

1. **税前与税后储蓄需求对比**  
   1. **问题**：每年末提取\$100，持续4年（年利率5%，税率35%），当前需存入多少？  
   2. **税前计算**（忽略税收）：  
     \[
     PV = \frac{100}{1.05} + \frac{100}{1.05^2} + \frac{100}{1.05^3} + \frac{100}{1.05^4} \approx 354.60
     \]
   3. **税后计算**（使用税后贴现率 \( R_t = 5\% \times (1 - 0.35) = 3.25\% \)）：  
     \[
     PV = \frac{100}{1.0325} + \frac{100}{1.0325^2} + \frac{100}{1.0325^3} + \frac{100}{1.0325^4} \approx 369.50
     \]
   4. **结论**：因税收影响，初始储蓄需从\$354.60增加至\$369.50，差额\$14.90为税收的现值。

2. **动态现金流验证**  
   1. **存入\$369.50后的账户动态**（年利率5%，税率35%）：  
      1. **第1年末**：  
       利息收入 = \( 369.50 \times 5\% = 18.48 \) → 税后利息 = \( 18.48 \times (1 - 0.35) = 12.01 \)  
       余额 = \( 369.50 + 12.01 = 381.51 \) → 提款\$100 → 剩余\$281.51  
      2. **后续年份**重复计算，最终第4年末余额归零，验证税后储蓄金额准确性。

#### 4. 扩展理解

1. **税收现值的计算**  
   1. 税收导致的储蓄差额（\$14.90）等于税收现金流的现值（以税前贴现率5%计算）：  
     \[
     PV_{\text{税收}} = \sum_{t=1}^4 \frac{\text{第t年税负}}{1.05^t} = 14.90
     \]

2. **税率波动的影响**  
   1. 税率随时间及政策变化（如历史最高达90%），需动态调整税后贴现率以反映实际税负。

3. **多税种差异**  
   1. 不同收入类型（股息、利息、资本利得）税率不同（如美国股息税率低于利息税率），需针对性调整贴现率。

---

#### 关键结论

1. **税收显著影响财务决策**：忽略税收将低估所需储蓄或高估投资回报，导致资金短缺风险。  
2. **调整贴现率**：使用税后贴现率（而非名义利率）是准确评估税后现金流价值的关键。  
3. **实际储蓄需求增加**：税收减少实际收益，需存入更多初始资金以满足未来提款目标。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Time Value of Money

引言：

Welcome to Introduction to Corporate Finance! This first module will introduce you to one of the most important foundational concepts in Finance, the time value of money. Before diving into the Video lectures, I encourage you to take a look at the brief pre-reading for the course. Specifically, have a look at “Big Picture Course Motivation,” for additional motivation and context for the course, “Time Value of Money Overview,” for a motivation and context for our first topic, and “Quiz Problem Answer Input.” This last note is particularly important to avoid confusion with the problem sets. Then, go to the Video Lectures and start learning Finance!

### 第一章：Time Value of Money

#### 视频小节4：Taxes

字幕文本：

Welcome back to corporate finance. Last time we talked about some useful shortcuts to compute the present value and future value of cash flow streams that we commonly come across in practice. Streams like perpetuities and annuities, and growing perpetuities and growing annuities. This time, I want to shift gears and talk about taxes and their impact on our dollar returns. Let's get started. Hi everyone welcome back to corporate finance. Last time we talked about several useful shortcuts for computing the present value of a cash flow stream. We talked about annuities, and growing annuities, and perpetuities and growing perpetuities. And we also discussed that these cash flow streams were representative of cash flow streams we might find in practice. What I want to do now is I want to shift gears and talk about taxes. In particular, I want to talk about how taxes impact our discount rate, our cost of capital, and ultimately how they impact our dollar returns. So let's get started.

I want to start with a little bit of motivation. I know we don't have a lot of time, but it's worth mentioning a few things. This is a picture of the top statutory tax rate on different sources of income. In particular, dividends which is blue line, capital gains which is the red line, and interest income which is the green line.

And I don't want to make too much of this picture, but I just want to emphasize a couple of things. First, you should see that the tax rates are moving all over the place. There's a enormous amount of variation in taxes over time, number one. And number two, you can see that historically, right? Tax rates have gotten really high. Now, admittedly it's not clear to how many people those tax rates of 90, 95% actually applied, but taxes are substantial and they move around a lot over time. So it's important to understand how they impact our investment income.

So lets do illustrate this by example. And I want to revisit an example we looked at in the past in particular, in our first lecture on discounting. So the question is how much do you have to save today to withdraw $100 at the end of each of the next four years if you can earn 5% per annum? Well, recall the first thing we do is we lay out a time line, and here are our cash flows, right? We're going to be withdrawing $100 a year over the next four years, and the question is asking, how much do we need today? So what we did was we discounted each cash flow, each of the $100 by the 5% discount rate to get the present value. So, for example, we took this first 100. 100 divided by 1 plus .05. And that got us $95.24 approximately. And we took the second cash flow, 100 divided by 1 plus .05 squared.

That's a two. And that got us the second cash flow, and on and on. And then we could add these cash flows because they're all in the same time zero units and that produced our answer 354.60. Okay. Then when we thought about what was going on in the bank account recall, right? We would insert $354.60 into the account, it would then earn interest at 5%.

We'd add that to the previous balance, then we'd pull out some money, and that would reduce our balance and we would continue that for four years. At the end of the four years, we would be left with nothing. Okay? All right. But now, consider what happens when we have some taxes. See, now we put our $354.60 into the account. That earns interest at 5%, but now we have to pay taxes on that interest income and I'm going to assume that tax rate we're facing is 35% which isn't too far off from top statutory rate currently prevailing. So that 35% of the 17.73 is 6.21 in taxes. That's going to reduce our pre-withdrawal balance to 366.12. Then we pull out $100.00, and then we're left with 266.12 at the end of the first year.

Which by the way, the 266.12 is less than the 272.32 because of the taxes. Now, if we continue that process, we'll get down to zero but only because in the last year we can only pull out $83.06. That's all we have left in that last year. Okay? All right. So on net, we're $16.94 short. The taxes are reducing the funds available for withdrawl. We're running out of money early.

So the lesson here is that taxes reduce the return on our investment. The dollar return on our investment. And one way to account for that is an after tax discount rate, I'll call it Rt. And that equals our usual discount rate times 1 minus the tax rate.

Okay? So, for our example, the discount rate R, was 5%. And the tax rate, t, was 35%. For an after tax discount rate of 3.25%.

Now let's revisit the problem using this after tax discount rate.

So now when I discount all of these cash flows back to today, I'm going to use our t, which equals three and a quarter percent instead of the R which equals 5%. When we do that,

when we do the arithmetic and add all these numbers up, we get 369.50. A number that's bigger than the 354.60 we originally found with the 5% discount rate. Now let's run through the exercise of looking at what happens to the saving account. So now we put in 369.50. That's going to earn interest at 5%. We're going to pay taxes on that interest at a rate of 35%. Which generates a pre-withdrawal balance in the first year of 381.51. We pull out the $100 and then we're left with 281.51. We continue that process for a few more years, and at the end of four years we're left with nothing in the bank account and we've been able to pull out $100 each year.

So what's the implication? Well, we need to save more to withdraw $100 per year after taxes, right? In particular, we need to save 369.50 as opposed to the 354.60.

And it's also interesting to note that the difference in how much we had to save, the difference between the 369.50 and the 354.60, which equals 14.90, that equals the present value of the taxes at 5%. Check this. Discount these cash flows at 5% and see what the present value is. It should be $14.90.

Okay. Let's summarize this and bring it back together.

Taxes reduce our dollar return. The after-tax return is less than the pre-tax return. And it's less by a factor of one minus the tax rate that you're facing.

So we can discount by this after-tax return to see how much money we're going to have once we've swept out the effect of taxes. And given tax rates in the U.S., not to mention most of Europe and many other countries, taxes are significant and can have a huge impact on our cash flow streams, our savings behavior, and ultimately, our decision making.

So looking ahead, I want you to dive into the problems, work on the problem set.

And then we're going to look at inflation and investigate how inflation affects our cash flow stream and our decision making. Thank you and I look forward to seeing you in the next class.
