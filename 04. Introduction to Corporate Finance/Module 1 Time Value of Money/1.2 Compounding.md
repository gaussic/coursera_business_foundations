### 视频总结：Week 1 - 货币的时间价值（Time Value of Money）

#### **核心概念**
1. **复利（Compounding）的定义**  
   • **目的**：将现金流从当前或过去的时间点移动到未来某一时间点，计算其未来价值（Future Value, FV）。
   • **对比贴现（Discounting）**：贴现将未来现金流折现到当前（现值），复利则是将当前或过去的现金流复利至未来（终值）。

2. **复利因子（Compounding Factor）**  
   • 公式：\( \text{复利因子} = (1 + R)^t \)，其中：
     ◦ \( R \) = 利率（与贴现率相同，反映资本的机会成本和风险）
     ◦ \( t \) = 时间跨度（向前推移的期数）
   • **操作方向**：复利因子指数为正（\( +t \)），贴现因子指数为负（\( -t \)）。

3. **未来值（Future Value, FV）**  
   • 定义：当前或过去现金流在未来某一时点的等效价值，通过复利因子计算。
   • 公式：\( FV = CF \times (1 + R)^t \)
   • **应用示例**：
     ◦ **单笔投资**：当前投资$1,000（R=3.5%），3年后的未来值为$1,108.72。
     ◦ **多期储蓄**：每年存入$100（共3年），4年后的总未来值为$452.56（R=5%）。

4. **时间线的灵活应用**  
   • 可选择任意时间点（如第2年）作为基准，将其他现金流通过贴现或复利转换到该点，统一时间单位后相加。

---

#### **关键结论**
1. **复利与贴现的对称性**  
   • 复利和贴现是货币时间价值的双向操作：复利向前计算终值，贴现向后计算现值，两者通过利率 \( R \) 关联。

2. **未来值的多重解释**  
   • 未来值代表当前投资的终值，或未来某一时点的财富累积总额。
   • 示例中$452.56可视为：每年存入$100（共3年）并持续复利至第4年的总金额，或该储蓄计划的终值。

3. **时间线的重要性**  
   • 时间线是可视化工具，明确标注每期现金流的流入/流出时间和金额，避免时间单位混淆。
   • **规则**：必须将所有现金流转换到同一时间点后再进行加减运算。

4. **动态过程验证**  
   • 复利过程可通过逐年计算利息和本金验证。例如，$100存入后每年赚取5%利息，逐年叠加存款和利息，最终验证终值准确性。

5. **利率（R）的假设**  
   • 默认利率在时间维度上恒定，但现实中可能变化（后续课程将涉及利率曲线和期限结构）。

#### **下一步学习方向**
下一讲将讨论**常见现金流的现值与终值计算捷径**（如年金、永续年金），简化多期均匀现金流的计算流程，提升效率。复利与贴现的结合将构建完整的货币时间价值分析框架。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Time Value of Money

引言：

Welcome to Introduction to Corporate Finance! This first module will introduce you to one of the most important foundational concepts in Finance, the time value of money. Before diving into the Video lectures, I encourage you to take a look at the brief pre-reading for the course. Specifically, have a look at “Big Picture Course Motivation,” for additional motivation and context for the course, “Time Value of Money Overview,” for a motivation and context for our first topic, and “Quiz Problem Answer Input.” This last note is particularly important to avoid confusion with the problem sets. Then, go to the Video Lectures and start learning Finance!

### 第一章：Time Value of Money

#### 视频小节2：Compounding

字幕文本：

Welcome back to Corporate Finance. Last time, we introduced the time value of money. We started with some intuition. We introduced the tools, namely the timeline and the discount factor, and then we showed how to move money back in time via discounting. Today, I wanna go the other direction. I wanna move money forward in time via a process called compounding. Let's get started.

Hey, everyone. Welcome back to Corporate Finance. Today, we're gonna be talking about compounding but let me start off with a brief recap of what we did in the last lecture. Last time, we introduced the time value of money, the concept. We started off with some intuition and showed that money has a time unit that prevents money arriving at different points in time from being aggregated or added together. Then we introduced some tools associated with time value of money, notably, the time line, which is just a visual representation of when money is moving in or out. And the discount factor, which was our exchange rate for the time value of money. It allowed us to convert the time units on money, moving it forward or backward. And then, we applied those tools to move cash flows back in time via discounting. And the big lesson was don't add cash flows with different time units ever. Today, I wanna go the other direction and talk about compounding or moving cash flows forward in time. So, let's get started.

So compounding just refers to moving cash flows forward in time. And here's our familiar timeline, and what I'm doing is I'm taking each cash flow CF0, 1, 2, and 3 and moving them to period 4 via compounding. So focusing on cash flow 2, I move that forward to period 4 by taking cashflow 2, multiplying it by my discount factor raised to the power of 2. Because I'm moving it two periods forward, and it's positive because I'm moving it forward.

More generally, all of the exponents are positive, again, because we're moving all of the cash flows forward in time.

Now, I can add all of these cash flows now because they're all in the same time units. I can add all of these cash flows. They're all in date 4 time units.

Now, these cash flows, once they've been moved forward are referred to as future values, right? So, again, this is just notation, like with present values. This is the future value as of period 4 of cash flow 3, the future value as of period 4 of cash flow 2, and likewise for cash flows 1 and 0.

Let's do an example. How much money will I have after three years if I invest $1,000 in a savings account paying 3.5% interest per annum? Well, step one, put down a timeline. Okay, put the cash flows on a timeline. So, I'm gonna invest $1000 today, period 0. And the question's asking how much money will I have in three years?

Well, all we're gonna do is move the cash flow forward in time by compounding. I'm gonna multiply by 1+R, where R is 3.5% in this case, and I'm moving the cash flow three years forward in time. So that's a positive 3 exponent on my discount factor.

If we do the arithmetic, we get that the $1,000 is worth $1,108.72 or just under $0.72.

And I should also mention that this is just the future value of the 1,000. In particular, it's the future value as of period 3 of the cash flow in period 0 which was $1,000.

Let's do a second example. How much money will we have four years from today if we save $1,000 a year, beginning today, for the next three years, assuming we earn 5% per annum? Step 1, put the cash flows on a timeline. That's exactly right. So, we're saving $100 a year beginning today for the next three years.

We're gonna earn 5%, and I wanna know how much I have after four years.

Well, to do that we're gonna have to move each cash flow forward in time to period 4. So look at the cash flow in period 3, I need to move that forward one period, so I multiply by 1 + R raised to the positive power 1, we're going forward one period. Cash flow two has to go forward two periods. So we're gonna multiply that by our discount factor raised to the power positive 2. And likewise, for the cash flows in period 0 today, and one year from today. If we do the arithmetic, we get these future values of the cash flows, right, 105, 110, 115, 121. We can now add all of these cash flows, cuz they're all on the same time for period 4 time units. And if we do that, I get 452.564. So what does this mean? How do we interpret that? Well, we will have $452.56 at the end of four years if we save $100 starting today for the next three years, and our money earns 5% per annum. Interpretation 2, the future value four years from today of saving $100 starting today for the next three years at 5% per annum is $452.56. So, what's going on here? What's going on behind the scenes? Well, we're gonna deposit $100 today.

That's gonna earn 5% interest and give us an additional $5 at the end of year one. So our pre-deposit balance, that's pre before our next deposit, is just $105, which by the way, is also equal to the future value one period hence of the $100, right? The future value of this $100 one period hence is just the 100 x 1+r to the 1. I deposit another $100, and I've got $205 after the first year. We continue this process for four years, and lo and behold, we're left with $452.56 at the end of the fourth year. More generally, there's nothing special about moving the cash flows to the end of the timeline or the beginning. You can move them anywhere, just as long as you're consistent. We can pick any point in time, such as period 2, and I can move cash flows 3 and 4 back in time.

And by applying a discount factor rates to a negative value, I can move the cash flows today and the cashflow one year from today forward in time by applying a positive exponent to the discount factor. And now, these cash flows here are all in the same time 2 period units, all right. So, let's summarize this up. We use compounding to move cash flows forward. We apply a discount factor with a positive exponent to move them forward in time, and that gives us future values.

So what I wanna see you do now is work on the problem set.

And then, coming up next in our next lecture, I want to talk about some useful shortcuts for present value and future value of common streams of cash flows. So, thanks again for listening, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
