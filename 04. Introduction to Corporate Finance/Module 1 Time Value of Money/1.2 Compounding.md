## Coursera 商业基础课程《企业财务导论》 - 模块1 - 货币的时间价值

### 课程1.2 复利

#### 1. 核心概念

1. **复利（Compounding）的本质**  
   1. 复利是将当前或未来的现金流**向前移动**至某一未来时点的过程，与贴现（Discounting）互为逆操作。  
   2. **工具**：使用**复利因子**（即贴现因子的正指数形式）转换时间单位，公式为：  
     \[
     \text{复利因子} = (1+R)^t
     \]
     其中，`R`为利率，`t`为向前移动的期数。

2. **未来价值（Future Value, FV）**  
   1. 未来价值表示当前或分阶段现金流在某一未来时点的汇总价值，所有现金流需通过复利转换至同一时间单位后相加。

#### 2. 关键规则与操作

1. **复利计算步骤**  
   1. **步骤1**：绘制时间轴，明确各期现金流（CF₀, CF₁, ..., CFₙ）的时点与方向。  
   2. **步骤2**：对每笔现金流应用复利因子，公式为：  
     \[
     FV_t = CF_k \times (1+R)^{t-k}
     \]
     其中，`k`为现金流原始时点，`t`为目标未来时点。  
   3. **步骤3**：汇总所有转换后的现金流，得到总未来价值。

2. **时间轴的灵活性**  
   1. 现金流可移动到**任意目标时点**（如示例中的第4年或第2年），只需保持计算一致性。

#### 3. 实例应用

1. **单笔投资的未来价值**  
   1. **问题**：当前投资\$1,000，年利率3.5%，3年后价值多少？  
   2. **解答**：  
     \[
     FV_3 = 1000 \times (1+0.035)^3 \approx 1,108.72
     \]
   3. **结论**：3年后价值为\$1,108.72。

2. **多期储蓄的未来价值**  
   1. **问题**：每年初存入\$100，连续4年，年利率5%，第4年末账户余额多少？  
   2. **步骤**： 
      1. 时间轴：第0、1、2、3年存入\$100，目标时点为第4年末。  
      2. 计算每笔存款的复利：  
       \[
       \begin{align*}
       FV_4 (\text{第0年存款}) &= 100 \times (1.05)^4 \approx 121.55 \\
       FV_4 (\text{第1年存款}) &= 100 \times (1.05)^3 \approx 115.76 \\
       FV_4 (\text{第2年存款}) &= 100 \times (1.05)^2 \approx 110.25
       \\
       FV_4 (\text{第3年存款}) &= 100 \times (1.05)^1 \approx 105.00 \\
       \end{align*}
       \]
      3. 总未来价值：  
       \[
       121.55 + 115.76 + 110.25 + 105.00 = 452.56
       \]
   3. **结论**：第4年末账户余额为\$452.56。

#### 4. 扩展理解

1. **动态复利过程**  
   1. 以多期储蓄为例，每年末计算利息并累加存款：  
      1. **第1年末**：\$100 × 1.05 = \$105 → 存入\$100 → 余额\$205  
      2. **第2年末**：\$205 × 1.05 ≈ \$215.25 → 存入\$100 → 余额\$315.25  
      3. **第3年末**：\$315.25 × 1.05 ≈ \$331.01 → 存入\$100 → 余额\$431.01  
      4. **第4年末**：\$431.01 × 1.05 ≈ \$452.56  
   2. 验证分步计算与直接复利公式的一致性。

2. **复利与贴现的关系**  
   1. 复利（正向移动）与贴现（逆向移动）使用同一贴现因子，仅指数符号不同：  
     \[
     \text{复利因子} = (1+R)^t, \quad \text{贴现因子} = \frac{1}{(1+R)^t}
     \]

---

#### 关键结论

1. **复利是时间价值的核心工具**：用于计算当前或分阶段投资在未来时点的累积价值。  
2. **操作要点**：  
   1. 始终通过时间轴明确现金流时序。  
   2. 复利计算需统一所有现金流至同一未来时点。  
3. **应用场景**：储蓄计划、长期投资回报预测、分期存款终值计算等。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Time Value of Money

引言：

Welcome to Introduction to Corporate Finance! This first module will introduce you to one of the most important foundational concepts in Finance, the time value of money. Before diving into the Video lectures, I encourage you to take a look at the brief pre-reading for the course. Specifically, have a look at “Big Picture Course Motivation,” for additional motivation and context for the course, “Time Value of Money Overview,” for a motivation and context for our first topic, and “Quiz Problem Answer Input.” This last note is particularly important to avoid confusion with the problem sets. Then, go to the Video Lectures and start learning Finance!

### 第一章：Time Value of Money

#### 视频小节2：Compounding

字幕文本：

Welcome back to Corporate Finance. Last time, we introduced the time value of money. We started with some intuition. We introduced the tools, namely the timeline and the discount factor, and then we showed how to move money back in time via discounting. Today, I wanna go the other direction. I wanna move money forward in time via a process called compounding. Let's get started.

Hey, everyone. Welcome back to Corporate Finance. Today, we're gonna be talking about compounding but let me start off with a brief recap of what we did in the last lecture. Last time, we introduced the time value of money, the concept. We started off with some intuition and showed that money has a time unit that prevents money arriving at different points in time from being aggregated or added together. Then we introduced some tools associated with time value of money, notably, the time line, which is just a visual representation of when money is moving in or out. And the discount factor, which was our exchange rate for the time value of money. It allowed us to convert the time units on money, moving it forward or backward. And then, we applied those tools to move cash flows back in time via discounting. And the big lesson was don't add cash flows with different time units ever. Today, I wanna go the other direction and talk about compounding or moving cash flows forward in time. So, let's get started.

So compounding just refers to moving cash flows forward in time. And here's our familiar timeline, and what I'm doing is I'm taking each cash flow CF0, 1, 2, and 3 and moving them to period 4 via compounding. So focusing on cash flow 2, I move that forward to period 4 by taking cashflow 2, multiplying it by my discount factor raised to the power of 2. Because I'm moving it two periods forward, and it's positive because I'm moving it forward.

More generally, all of the exponents are positive, again, because we're moving all of the cash flows forward in time.

Now, I can add all of these cash flows now because they're all in the same time units. I can add all of these cash flows. They're all in date 4 time units.

Now, these cash flows, once they've been moved forward are referred to as future values, right? So, again, this is just notation, like with present values. This is the future value as of period 4 of cash flow 3, the future value as of period 4 of cash flow 2, and likewise for cash flows 1 and 0.

Let's do an example. How much money will I have after three years if I invest $1,000 in a savings account paying 3.5% interest per annum? Well, step one, put down a timeline. Okay, put the cash flows on a timeline. So, I'm gonna invest $1000 today, period 0. And the question's asking how much money will I have in three years?

Well, all we're gonna do is move the cash flow forward in time by compounding. I'm gonna multiply by 1+R, where R is 3.5% in this case, and I'm moving the cash flow three years forward in time. So that's a positive 3 exponent on my discount factor.

If we do the arithmetic, we get that the $1,000 is worth $1,108.72 or just under $0.72.

And I should also mention that this is just the future value of the 1,000. In particular, it's the future value as of period 3 of the cash flow in period 0 which was $1,000.

Let's do a second example. How much money will we have four years from today if we save $1,000 a year, beginning today, for the next three years, assuming we earn 5% per annum? Step 1, put the cash flows on a timeline. That's exactly right. So, we're saving $100 a year beginning today for the next three years.

We're gonna earn 5%, and I wanna know how much I have after four years.

Well, to do that we're gonna have to move each cash flow forward in time to period 4. So look at the cash flow in period 3, I need to move that forward one period, so I multiply by 1 + R raised to the positive power 1, we're going forward one period. Cash flow two has to go forward two periods. So we're gonna multiply that by our discount factor raised to the power positive 2. And likewise, for the cash flows in period 0 today, and one year from today. If we do the arithmetic, we get these future values of the cash flows, right, 105, 110, 115, 121. We can now add all of these cash flows, cuz they're all on the same time for period 4 time units. And if we do that, I get 452.564. So what does this mean? How do we interpret that? Well, we will have $452.56 at the end of four years if we save $100 starting today for the next three years, and our money earns 5% per annum. Interpretation 2, the future value four years from today of saving $100 starting today for the next three years at 5% per annum is $452.56. So, what's going on here? What's going on behind the scenes? Well, we're gonna deposit $100 today.

That's gonna earn 5% interest and give us an additional $5 at the end of year one. So our pre-deposit balance, that's pre before our next deposit, is just $105, which by the way, is also equal to the future value one period hence of the $100, right? The future value of this $100 one period hence is just the 100 x 1+r to the 1. I deposit another $100, and I've got $205 after the first year. We continue this process for four years, and lo and behold, we're left with $452.56 at the end of the fourth year. More generally, there's nothing special about moving the cash flows to the end of the timeline or the beginning. You can move them anywhere, just as long as you're consistent. We can pick any point in time, such as period 2, and I can move cash flows 3 and 4 back in time.

And by applying a discount factor rates to a negative value, I can move the cash flows today and the cashflow one year from today forward in time by applying a positive exponent to the discount factor. And now, these cash flows here are all in the same time 2 period units, all right. So, let's summarize this up. We use compounding to move cash flows forward. We apply a discount factor with a positive exponent to move them forward in time, and that gives us future values.

So what I wanna see you do now is work on the problem set.

And then, coming up next in our next lecture, I want to talk about some useful shortcuts for present value and future value of common streams of cash flows. So, thanks again for listening, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
