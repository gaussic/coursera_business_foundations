### 课程1.8 绩效管理

传统绩效评估体系的局限性与新兴替代模式，强调**持续反馈**与**心理安全**在提升员工表现中的核心作用，揭示评估过程中的认知偏差与系统性缺陷。

#### 1. 绩效评估的历史演变与核心目标 

- **起源**：  
  - **19世纪英国**：Robert Owen的棉纺厂用彩色纺锤标识工人绩效（可视化即时反馈）。  
  - **二战美国**：政府立法推动绩效评估，防范歧视并规范联邦部门管理。  
- **传统三目标**：  
  - **评估过去**（奖励依据）；  
  - **改进当前**（技能提升）；  
  - **规划未来**（职业发展）。  
- **现代异化**：过度聚焦量化指标（如强制排名、目标分解），忽视人性化沟通与文化适配。

#### 2. 传统绩效评估的五大系统性缺陷  

- **认知偏差**：  
  - **过度自信偏差**：员工普遍自评高于实际（平均自认80分位，实际50分位），导致反馈抵触。  
  - **基本归因错误**：管理者将低效归因于「人差」而非「情境」（如堵车超车者被判定为「混蛋」而非紧急情况）。  
  - **自我实现预言**：管理者对「高潜力者」投入更多资源，加剧表现差异（如忽视「普通员工」的成长机会）。  
- **反馈延迟**：年度评估无法关联实时行为，信息失真（如「电话传话游戏」效应）。  
- **激励失效**：薪酬涨幅有限（2%-3%）削弱评估动力，员工视其为「流程任务」。  
- **文化冲突**：强制排名破坏协作（如微软曾因「末位淘汰制」导致内部恶性竞争）。  

#### 3. 新兴替代模式：持续反馈与取消评估  

- **趋势**：微软、IBM、GE等企业取消年度评估，转向：  
  - **高频对话**：管理者与员工定期（如月度）非正式沟通，聚焦即时问题解决。  
  - **动态目标**：脱离「年度计划分解」，适应业务快速迭代（如OKR季度调整）。  
  - **心理安全（Psychological Safety）**：  
    - **定义**：员工不因坦诚错误或弱点受罚（如谷歌「安全失败」文化）。  
    - **实践**：分离反馈与薪酬决策，避免「圣诞老人效应」（员工隐瞒问题以保奖金）。  
- **优势**：  
  - **降低认知负荷**：实时反馈减少记忆偏差；  
  - **增强适应性**：快速响应市场变化；  
  - **提升归属感**：员工感知被尊重而非「考核对象」。  

#### 4. 有效反馈的科学原则

- **负面反馈的「七倍效应」**：员工对批评的敏感度远高于表扬，需谨慎措辞（如「三明治反馈法」：肯定-建议-鼓励）。  
- **行为锚定（Behavioral Anchoring）**：  
  - **举例**：替代「你沟通能力差」，改为「上周客户会议中，3次打断同事发言，建议使用倾听笔记」。  
- **发展性对话**：  
  - **提问导向**：「哪些资源能帮你提升？」而非「为什么没达标？」 
  - **共情表达**：承认情境限制（如「我知道项目周期紧张，但代码质量需优先」）。  

#### 实践启示  

- **重构评估流程**：  
  - **从年度到日常**：用Slack/Trello记录里程碑反馈，替代年终集中评审。  
  - **360度轻量化**：季度匿名同事互评（3-5个关键词），避免繁琐表单。  
- **管理者赋能**：  
  - **偏差训练**：通过案例研讨（如归因错误模拟）提升评估客观性。  
  - **反馈工具箱**：提供话术模板（如「我观察到…+影响…+建议…」）。  
- **文化基建**：  
  - **透明薪酬公式**：如Buffer公开薪资计算器（岗位+经验+绩效系数），减少猜疑。  
  - **失败复盘会**：定期分享「搞砸」案例（如Spotify的「Fail Wall」），弱化惩罚 stigma。  
- **技术工具辅助**：  
  - **AI情绪分析**：如Humu用NLP分析员工反馈，提示管理者沟通风险点。  
  - **数据看板**：实时展示目标进度（如Asana整合OKR与任务流），替代年终PPT汇报。  

---

#### 总结

- **评估的本质是持续对话**：传统「打分制」终将被敏捷反馈机制取代，核心是建立信任而非控制。  
- **人性化 > 标准化**：抑制认知偏差需制度设计（如匿名校准会）与文化浸润（心理安全）双轨并进。  
- **未来导向**：绩效管理正从「向后看问责」转向「向前看赋能」，目标是构建**学习型组织**而非「考核机器」。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Motivation and Reward

引言：In this module, you'll learn how motivation affects an individual's performance and how to use that motivation to drive performance. You'll explore how incentive systems are designed and how psychological concepts such as behavior modification, imitation, conformity, and compliance influence and shape these systems. You’ll also examine the current process of hiring employees using technology, tracking systems, and outsourcing. And you’ll learn how you can provide valuable feedback to your employees, and make performance appraisals productive. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to apply what you've learned to best motivate, hire, and evaluate your employees.

### 第二章：Module 1

#### 视频小节6：Managing Performance

字幕文本：

We're going to talk on different aspect of management now, one that's related to motivation, and this is managing performance and the process of performance appraisals. This is something which is now ubiquitous In most parts of the world. In the US, it's been in place for a long time. Let's talk a little bit about the history of this. It started in England in the 1800s when Robert Owen's cotton mills were in business. And apparently, you got a colored spindle in front of your weaving machine to indicate how well you've been performing. Everybody could walk past and get a sense of how good a performer you were by the color of your spindle. In the US, this was a World War II invention. And we started to see a lot of legislation coming in place to require it for the federal government, and also to make sure it doesn't discriminate against people. And there's pretty good evidence that there is something, certainly, to performance appraisals. They do something that works. It's not completely biased, though there's a lot of bias in it, but It's really unpopular, and let's talk a little bit about why it's so unpopular, particularly now. And I think the reason is we've asked it to do a lot of things. So in the past, when it was first started, there were three things performance appraisal was supposed to do. It was supposed to asses your past performance and reward you for it, sort of the incentive model, a little bit. It was supposed to help you get better at your current job and improve your performance. And it was supposed to, in the corporate world, help you plan your career path and get better at a bunch of skills so that you could take on bigger jobs that were valuable over time.

And in the 1950s, the big focus was on the planning your development part, and they weren't paying much attention to your performance at all. But over time, that started to shift toward assessing performance. And we started to see, again, you can look in textbooks now, a model of performance management which is pretty mechanical. A company sets goals, the goals cascade down to the departments, which then move to the individuals. So you're supposed to develop individual goal setting for this year, which fit into the company's goals for this year. Then we moved toward models of competency-based performance appraisal, where your supervisor is supposed to assess you, not just on your overall performance, but the extent to which you manifest certain competencies or skills. And lots of complex scales and forced rankings, which are kind of a tournament-based system, in order to try to force distributions of people, all in the goal of trying to do more to assess your past performance. There's a lot of reasons why this doesn't work very well, and you can look down the list on the slide here. And you can see the gap between something you did and what the supervisor tells you about it, [LAUGH] concludes about it at the end of a year. It's kind of like that game of telephone, where information is passed around lots of different people. In this case, there's a big time delay, especially if the performance exercise is the end of the year. It's pretty difficult for a supervisor to remember everything you did accurately, let alone to give you feedback about that. The reason people dislike performance appraisal so much is because it creates conflict, or you might say it just brings to the surface a pretty obvious conflict. And here's the conflict. You can see this is a bell-shaped distribution, a normal distribution. And if this is performance we're talking about, the average employee, by definition, is in the middle, right, the 50th percentile, 0 in this case, on the scale in the x-axis. Where this the average employee believe they are? The average employee believes they are in the 80th percentile, so the average employee believes they're well above average. Now, why is that? It's a bias called the overconfidence bias, and particularly, where we don't know much about what we're doing, we are way overconfident about how well we are doing it. People who are given, in a laboratory context, a task to perform where it looks like they've got a 50% chance of doing it well, or winning if it's a game, they believe their odds of winning are 75%. We're systematically overconfident, and we're more overconfident about the things we know the least about. So you're a supervisor, and you see me after a year and you call me in. And I'm an average performer, and you tell me, you're doing fine, pretty okay. You're an average performer. And I think I'm at the 80th percentile. What happens? Well, cognitive dissonance in my head, and I'm not happy about it. I'm not happy about the fact that you believe I’m average when I think I’m above average. And it’s easier for me to just blame you for this than it is for me to, maybe, adjust my view of myself. So I’m angry at you for the next year, right? So supervisors don’t like to do this. The employees often believe they're going to be told something that they don't like to hear. And so these conversations don't go well. Nobody wants to do them, which is why human resource departments have to bang on people to get performance appraisals done in the first place. That's the unfortunate and uncomfortable nature of performance appraisals. And it's also worth noting that supervisors are not always completely accurate about their assessments of people. There are a bunch of biases that we know affect performance scores. Maybe the most important is something called the fundamental attribution error. And this a bias that we have when we look at human behavior to assume that the behavior is the result of dispositions. If somebody does something bad, it’s because they’re a bad person, rather than the circumstances. So a classic story about this. If you’re driving home in traffic at night and everything stop and go, and somebody comes zipping by you on the shoulder of the road, what's your first reaction? I bet you think, that guy is a jerk, rather than think, she's probably on the way to the hospital. It's an emergency, right? We never imagine that it could be circumstance. We're inclined to write that person off because of what they're doing, attribute their apparently bad behavior to who they are as a person. So in a performance appraisal context, this means supervisors are kind of inclined to write off poor performance by saying it's a result of the person. They're a bad performer. And as a result, they tend not to manage them carefully anymore and kind of blow them away. And the second aspect of bias, which is just as important, is self-fulfilling prophecies. And that means if we've got an employee coming in to our workplace who we believe is a very good worker, people say great things about him, we tend to manage them differently. We give them more opportunities. We don't settle for poor performance from them. We push them harder to improve their performance. If we think they're a good worker coming in, we manage them in ways that make them better. And the opposite is also true if we get somebody in who we think is not so great, somebody who we don't think cleared the hurdle for hiring by much. Somebody says bad things about them when they come in. We don't manage them the same way. We're more tolerant of poor performance. We don't push them as hard. Maybe we think they're not capable of as much. We don't give them opportunities to shine. We don't devote as much attention to them, and they don't perform as well. So the supervisor is causing the performance differences here. And we also know there are a lot biases related to relationships. We give better scores to people who are more like us. We give better scores to people who are physically more attractive, etc. So the supervisors are not perfect at assessing employees at all, which is another part of the problem. So we see a model emerging, which again, is very different than what you might see in contemporary textbooks. About a third of companies are moving in the direction, or they're already there, and this is US companies, anyway, toward a model which gets rid of formal appraisals altogether. At the end of the year, there's no sitdown, there's no form to fill out, there's no score. What they've got instead is a model where you and your supervisor are having conversations frequently, all the time about how things are going. And they're doing this in part because the model of accountability is just not that important. That is, holding people accountable for how things performed last year, partly because they're recognizing the incentive model doesn't work all that well, especially in a period that we've been in for decades now where merit pay increases are pretty small, a couple of percent. So how many hoops are you going to jump through for an increase which is not going to be that much different than you would have gotten anyway, at least in terms of dollar amounts? And also, I think a lot of companies are recognizing that the annual business cycle doesn't make sense anymore. They don't have annual business plans that matter. You can't cascade down to individual goals from those plans, and so forth. A conversational model is much more flexible and helps people talk because the conversation is all the time, not just at the end of the year, about things when they happen and how to fix them. Now, it's an interesting bet as to how this is going to play out. It's a bet the companies are making. There's a lot of big companies in this, Microsoft, IBM, GE, that are betting that they can, through organization, culture, get managers to lead these conversations with subordinates, and do them all the time in a way that a rule we used to have at the end of the year, one conversation, one scale, one assessment, didn't seem to help us. So it'll be interesting to watch how this plays out. But for a lot of firms, and particularly a lot of leading firms, they've given up on the performance appraisal model altogether.

This alternative model of check-ins, but also the model of regular performance appraisals involves giving feedback. And that means a supervisor has got to give the employees feedback about how they're doing, try to get them to perform better in a way that they can actually take in and listen. And a key aspect here is the idea of "psychological safety", as psychologists refer to this. We might think of it as kind of common sense. I'm not going to tell you, the boss, something that you're going to punish me for. So at the end of the year, when you're meeting me and we're talking about my performance, and you're going to give me a merit pay increase after this conversation, and you ask me how things went this year, I'm not going to tell you about problems. It's like talking to Santa Claus, right? Santa Claus is asking you if you've been good this year and he's going to give you presents afterwards. I'm not going to tell you I was a jerk this year, right? So you don't get much of a conversation at that point. So can we create a context where there really is a discussion? And I'm going to tell you the truth. That only happens if there's no bad consequences for me revealing problems, and that means not in the context of merit pay increases. There's also something called a negativity bias, which is hard to get our hands around, and that means that people really do worry about bad feedback. If there's a piece of negative information about us, we disproportionately focus on it seven times or more as much attention paid to a piece of negative information as we would give to an equivalent piece of positive feedback, right? So this means that we ought to think about how people are going to interpret what we tell them, not just give them straight-up feedback and then let them worry about it, because we know the way they process it is going to be heavily weighted toward whatever negative things we say. So we've gotta be pretty careful about how we code all that up and present it to them. As a supervisor, there's probably nothing more important than giving employees feedback. It's a way of, first of all, helping them get better at their current job, which is really important for the organization. It is a way to help them build their career. And for the business, and particularly the belief in the importance of incentives, it is the way in which we let them know how they're doing. So if you're a supervisor, I would say the single most important thing to worry about is getting better at giving people feedback in a way that they can take it in, that doesn't threaten them. They're really listening to what you say, and they're going to change their behavior because of it. So we think about all the topics around management. A couple of the biggest ones we've talked about today, motivation and managing performance. In our next edition here, we're going to talk about some other more macro level, organization level issues around managing people. And that is how to bundle a lot of these things together into systems that fit with business operating models and fit with business strategy.
