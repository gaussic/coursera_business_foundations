## Coursera 商业基础课程《管理社会与人力资本》 - 模块1 - 动机与激励

### 课程1.5 动机：代理理论案例

通过历史与当代案例揭示**激励设计错位**（Rewarding A While Hoping for B）的严重后果，强调**目标与激励一致性**在管理中的核心地位。

#### 1. 代理理论的核心矛盾
 
- **利益冲突**：委托人（雇主）与代理人（员工）目标不一致，激励设计若仅关注短期或表面行为，可能引发系统性风险。  
- **案例1：澳大利亚囚犯运输（18世纪）**  
  - **初始激励**：按上船囚犯人数支付船主报酬 → 船主克扣生存物资，囚犯死亡率超50%。  
  - **调整后激励**：按存活抵澳人数支付 → 死亡率降至2%。  
  - **启示**：激励需直接绑定最终目标（存活率），而非中间行为（运输人数）。  
- **案例2：苏联和平号空间站事故**  
  - **错误激励**：宇航员奖金与「服从指令」挂钩，而非任务成功 → 被迫执行高风险手动对接（无自动导航设备），险些导致空间站损毁。  
  - **启示**：过度强调「过程合规」可能牺牲长期安全与战略目标。

#### 2. 激励错位的典型后果

- **短视行为**：员工优先完成激励指标（如运输量、指令执行），忽视隐性风险（如生命安全、任务可持续性）。  
- **道德风险**：代理人利用规则漏洞谋利（如船主通过牺牲囚犯降低成本）。  
- **目标偏离**：组织资源被导向「虚假成功」（如完成运输但损失人力资本）。

#### 3. 激励设计的关键原则 

- **结果导向**：激励需直接关联终极目标（如存活率、任务安全），避免中间指标异化（如运输量、指令执行次数）。  
- **动态校准**：定期评估激励系统副作用（如NASA通过「匿名安全报告」机制避免惩罚性追责）。  
- **平衡过程与结果**：  
  - **高风险领域**（如航天、医疗）：激励需兼顾安全流程与结果（如「零事故奖金+合规奖励」）。  
  - **创新领域**（如研发）：允许试错（如谷歌「20%自由时间」），但设定阶段性成果里程碑。

#### 4. 现代管理启示 

- **避免单一指标**：  
  - 使用复合指标（如客户满意度+销售额）替代单一KPI（如销量）。  
  - 案例：Salesforce将员工绩效与客户留存率、产品创新贡献多维绑定。  
- **信任与透明**：  
  - 减少「监督依赖」，通过文化塑造（如NASA「安全第一」文化）替代强制合规。  
  - 案例：Netflix取消报销流程审批，依靠员工自主决策+事后抽查。  
- **长期视角**：  
  - 股权激励、职业发展通道（如内部晋升优先）替代短期现金奖励。  

---

#### 总结

- **激励是双刃剑**：设计不当将引发「目标腐蚀」，需以终为始定义成功标准。  
- **系统性思维**：将激励嵌入组织战略（如安全、创新），而非孤立设计奖惩规则。  
- **人性化平衡**：通过信任文化（如自主权）对冲代理风险，降低「监管成本」。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Motivation and Reward

引言：In this module, you'll learn how motivation affects an individual's performance and how to use that motivation to drive performance. You'll explore how incentive systems are designed and how psychological concepts such as behavior modification, imitation, conformity, and compliance influence and shape these systems. You’ll also examine the current process of hiring employees using technology, tracking systems, and outsourcing. And you’ll learn how you can provide valuable feedback to your employees, and make performance appraisals productive. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to apply what you've learned to best motivate, hire, and evaluate your employees.

#### 视频小节3：Motivation: The Agency Theory Examples

字幕文本：

But maybe the biggest problem associated with the economics based incentive model of motivation, the agency model. Is that it's easy to get the incentives out of alignment. And they could be out of alignment even a little bit. And they cause a ton of problems. So for example, it's a famous story which I learned from my colleague Mike. Who you're going to hear from a little later on this. About Australia, which began its civilization, modern western civilization anyway, as a prison colony for England. And at that time, you might have thought being sent to Australia from England particularly in the winter was a pretty good thing. Why not be in Sydney where the weather's pleasant? But it turned out the reason it was such a terrible thing to be sentenced to time in Australia. Was that a very large proportion, I think at one point a majority of people sent to Australia, died. So even if you were sent there for a two or three year sentence, highly likely that you might die. And the reason they were dying, a royal commissioner investigated is that they were dying on the way over. And what were they dying of? Dehydration, disease, exposure, all things that were preventable. Well, the Royal Commission took a little look in this. And they discovered that the English government was outsourcing the shipping of prisoners to Australia. They weren't doing it themselves, private ship captains were taking the passengers over. And the way they were paying the ship captains was so much per passenger. So, ten pounds or something for each prisoner who they shipped to Australia, right. Well, if you were a profit maximizing ship captain who didn't have any scruples. The way you would make a lot of money is you would skimp on food. You would skimp on blankets and heat. You would skimp on water. And actually if the prisoners died it was simpler for you because the boat didn't weigh as much. You just toss them overboard and you didn't have to feed them, and that's what was happening. So, the Royal Commission set up an alternative compensation system, which was very simple. It just paid the ship captains for the number of prisoners who walked off the boat on their own power in Sydney Harbor. And the death rate fell to maybe 2%, from a majority to just a couple of percent. So we talk about Rewarding A While Hoping for B. And that means the incentive system is hoping let's say to get passengers, prisoners to Australia in an efficient, inexpensive way. That's B, but what they're actually rewarding was simply piling people on the boat. So, it's unintended consequences. I've got a contemporary story about this which is in a very different context. It takes place in outer space. And it takes place on the Mir space station which was the Soviet era space station. Which turned out to be a pretty remarkable piece of engineering at least for a [INAUDIBLE]. It was in space for 20 years or so. And there was a moment where the Mir had an accident that was completely preventable. And we know the story about this because there was a U.S. astronaut on board with the cosmonauts. And he told the story afterwards. Here's what happened on the Mir, it's a classic example of rewarding a while hoping for b. What happened on the Mir. Is that they were serviced every month by a spaceship that would be launched from Siberia. [INAUDIBLE] ship called the Progress. And they would launch it full of oxygen, and food, and water, and whatever else they wanted, pizza, ship it up. And it would dock automatically with the Mir. They had this very elaborate computer and radar based system to pull it in and slowly dock. But, then as soon as it was done docking and they had unloaded it. They filled it up with trash and they kicked it back into space and it would spiral down to Earth and burn up in the process. Now, it worked pretty well except for the fact that's it's incredibly expensive pizza delivery, right? Because you're burning up one of those ships every time, every month, when you're servicing the Mir. So, the guys on the ground in mission control decided maybe there's a way to do this without quite as much expense. The most expensive part or one of the most expensive parts of the Progress, the ship that was coming up.

Was the avionics, that is the system for docking the Mir. So what they decided to do was to see whether it was possible to launch the Progress and dock it, without all that fancy avionics. So they tried it out, and they got it up there, and then they turned off everything. And they let the cosmonauts on the Mir steer it into the Mir. Now, the problem with doing this, imagine parallel parking, right? Except in this case, the curb is the Mir space station. And it's a bunch of pretty fragile stuff. There are no bumpers around it, right. It's got antennas and solar panels and stuff like that. The Progress is coming at you at 10,000 miles an hour. And they gotta slow it down, it's hundreds of miles away. And they got to slow it down enough to dock, and if you bump, [LAUGH] you've got a big problem. So, the Progress is coming at them and they can't see it, they can't find it. They're looking out the window trying to see where it is. And the radar image isn't clear. And they've got a camera on the Progress. But it can't quite pick the Mir out because it's looking at Earth behind it and it's white and they can't see it. And they finally get a glimpse of it and they try to slow it down. But they couldn't slow it enough and it went zooming past them and unfortunately it missed them. But if it had hit them it would've been a huge disaster. So the cosmonauts got on the phone and they called mission control and they said hey, this is really, really dangerous. And it almost killed us, we can't do this again. Now what happened on the Mir space station was that the cosmonauts were paid a pretty big bonus for following orders. So it wasn't for a successful mission, it was for following orders. That's what they were rewarded for, that's what they were actually rewarding. That was A while hoping for B in this case was a successful mission.
