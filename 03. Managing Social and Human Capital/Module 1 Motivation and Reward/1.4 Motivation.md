## Coursera 商业基础课程《管理社会与人力资本》 - 模块1 - 动机与激励

### 课程1.4 动机

探讨**员工激励的核心矛盾**：如何在「监督控制」与「自主信任」间平衡，并通过经济学模型（代理理论、效率工资、锦标赛理论）解析激励设计的有效性及局限性。


#### 1. 传统监督机制的困境 

- **案例：新奥尔良餐厅的现金管理**  
  - 停电时，餐厅用人工计算账单并派专人监督收银员，但需额外人员监督监督者，形成「无限监督链」。  
- **问题本质**：单纯依靠监督成本高、效率低，且无法解决信任缺失（如员工偷窃风险）。  
- **启示**：过度监督削弱员工责任感，需通过激励设计替代「人盯人」模式。  

#### 2. 经济学激励模型与局限性  

- **代理理论（Agency Model）**：  
  - **假设**：员工（代理人）与雇主（委托人）利益不一致，需通过契约（如绩效奖金）绑定双方目标。  
  - **失败案例**：软件工程师以项目进度要挟加薪，暴露「纯金钱激励」的脆弱性（员工缺乏组织忠诚）。  
  - **结论**：仅靠金钱无法解决深层动机问题（如承诺感、使命感）。  
- **效率工资（Efficiency Wages）**：  
  - **逻辑**：支付高于市场水平的薪资以：  
    -  吸引更优秀人才；  
    -  降低离职率（员工不愿失去高薪岗位）；  
    -  减少偷懒行为（员工珍惜高价值工作）。  
  - **证据支持**：高薪企业员工纪律问题更少。  
  - **风险**：若竞争对手同步加薪，优势消失（依赖相对薪资水平）。  
- **锦标赛理论（Tournament Theory）**：  
  - **模式**：通过晋升和层级薪资差异激励竞争（如CEO薪资远高于高管团队）。  
  - **优点**：低成本激励多数人参与「晋升竞赛」。  
  - **缺点**：
    - 破坏团队合作（员工为晋升相互竞争而非协作）； 
    - 逆向选择（优秀员工避开「强竞争环境」）。  

#### 3. 信任与自主权的新型激励

- **案例对比**：  
  - **传统企业**：依赖摄像头、监督员监控员工。  
  - **创新型公司（如Google、3M）**：赋予员工自主时间（如每周10小时自由探索项目），通过信任激发创造力。  
- **关键条件**：  
  - **文化匹配**：员工需认同企业使命（如Google的「创新驱动」文化）。  
  - **筛选机制**：招聘阶段选择高度自驱、价值观契合的人才。  

#### 4. 实践启示

- **混合激励设计**：  
  - **金钱激励**：确保薪资具备竞争力（效率工资原则），但避免「唯金钱论」。  
  - **非金钱激励**：赋予任务自主权（如项目选择权）、职业发展机会（如晋升透明化）。  
- **信任与监督平衡**：  
  - **高风险岗位**（如财务）：适度监督（如轮岗、审计）结合绩效奖励。  
  - **知识型工作**（如研发）：减少流程管控，通过目标管理（OKR）替代过程监控。  
- **规避锦标赛副作用**：  
  - **团队协作场景**：弱化个体竞争，强化团队绩效奖励（如项目奖金共享）。  
  - **晋升机制**：明确多维评估标准（如协作能力、创新贡献），避免单一结果导向。  
- **文化塑造**：  
  - 通过使命陈述（如「用户第一」）和内部沟通（如全员会议）增强员工归属感。  
  - 鼓励「主人翁精神」（如员工持股计划），将个人利益与组织长期目标绑定。

#### 总结

员工激励需**跳出「监督-控制」或「金钱-契约」的二元对立**，转向**系统性设计**：  
- **短期**：利用效率工资吸引人才，通过清晰目标（如KPI）降低代理成本。  
- **长期**：培育信任文化，赋予自主权，将员工从「经济代理人」转化为「使命合伙人」。  
- **动态调整**：根据业务性质（如标准化生产 vs 创新研发）选择适配模型，定期评估激励效果。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Motivation and Reward

引言：In this module, you'll learn how motivation affects an individual's performance and how to use that motivation to drive performance. You'll explore how incentive systems are designed and how psychological concepts such as behavior modification, imitation, conformity, and compliance influence and shape these systems. You’ll also examine the current process of hiring employees using technology, tracking systems, and outsourcing. And you’ll learn how you can provide valuable feedback to your employees, and make performance appraisals productive. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to apply what you've learned to best motivate, hire, and evaluate your employees.

### 第二章：Module 1

#### 视频小节2：Motivation

字幕文本：

How do you get the people who are working for you to do anything? Now it may seem like it's pretty simple. You just hire people and tell them what to do. Unless you've ever been an employee, of course, and then you realize that sometimes the employees don't want to do what you want them to do, and sometimes that's for principled reasons and sometimes it's because they're having a bad day, or they're tired, or whatever.

And the question is going to be how do you get employees to do what you want them to do? And I wanted to illustrate with a story that I saw myself in New Orleans, in a restaurant many years ago now, called Mothers. And in that restaurant I was there, sort of a cafeteria line, great food, and the electricity went off in the restaurant, but they kept going which was cool and admirable. But at the end of the food line you get to the point where they total up your bill and they take your money and give you change. Right? So there was somebody there with a calculator, totaling up your bill. And there was somebody there at the cash register. The cash register doesn't work because the electricity is off, calculators got batteries, cash register doesn't, so the cash register's not working. Cash registers are a controlled device, right? You put in what the food was, it says how much it was. At the end of the day you total that number up and it better correspond with the amount of cash in the drawer. Or if it's less, then somebody's probably stealing or made a mistake or something. So we get to the cash register right? And it's open, and there's somebody there who's taking your money and giving you change. But they're just doing it with an open box of cash right? Behind that person is another person who is standing there just looking over the shoulder of the person who is taking your money and giving you change. Now what is that person doing? Well, that person is just watching the person with the open cash drawer and probably I'm assuming, I didn't ask them, the reason is because they want to make sure that the person in front of the cash is not stealing cash. But then you might wonder, shouldn't there be a person standing behind the person who's watching the person with the open cash drawer to make sure that they're not in cahoots together?

Well, you start thinking about this and you realize one of the problems of management. You could try to manage people by having somebody stand over and watch them, but that doesn't work very well. First of all it's really expensive to do. Second, how can you trust the person who's watching if you can't trust the first person? So this is all around the question of motivation. How do you motivate people to work in the way that you want them to work? And that might include things like not stealing from you. In general you can think about it I think this way, I always think about this test. If your employees are doing the right thing for you, we talk sometimes also about questions of engagement now. A common phrase which means really commitment. Are they looking after your interest? If it's 5:00 in your office and it's quitting time and it's hit 5 o'clock and the phone's ringing. Do people go back and answer the phone or do they continue to walk out the door? Right? If they are committed to the organization, if they're engaged and looking after your interests, they might take the extra minute or so and answer the phone. If not, they're probably out the door. Right? And as an employer, you want to make sure people will go back in and answer that phone. You want to make sure that you can trust your employees with an open cash drawer and you don't need somebody standing behind them in order to figure out when they're cheating or not. So we're going to talk about how to do that and also understand some of the companies that describe how they manage in completely different ways than the example of the restaurant I was giving you. Companies that talk about, for example, giving their employees ten hours a week or so, Google I think was famous for this among others, 3M as well, to just work on stuff that the employees want to work on. Now, they could be sitting on their hands as far as their supervisors probably know, right? Because you're giving people discretion. And you're not supervising them, you're giving them autonomy to go do what they want to do that's in the interest of the company so you really got to trust them. What makes it possible to trust those people in those kind of companies, when in lots of other companies you've got cameras watching people. You've got supervisors standing over them. What's different in those two operations right? And we're going to talk about how you might make that happen as we go along in this course. So let's start talking about the simplest model of management. This is a model that is associated with economics people and economics call this an agency approach, agency model. The idea here is that you have an agent. The employee is like an agent who is working for you, and you are the principal. That is you are the person who is trying to guide the agent. Actually this is not the way employment works at all. But it is a useful abstraction to think about how it works, and we'll get to the more complicated, more realistic ideas in just a minute. So if you have an agent who's working for you, how might you motivate that person to do the right thing, and you don't want to stand over them and watch them? In our course at the Wharton School, we teach a case about a company called Automated Travel Systems, which was started awhile ago and created the software that drives search engines for finding flights now. And in that company they had a particularly difficult moment where their software engineers were holding the company up. I mean literally, talk about holdup company that's like you're sticking a gun at somebody, and the gun they were sticking is we're going to quit unless you give us more money or stock options, whatever it was, and in this particular company that was happening. The engineers were threatening to quit and the company was on a very short deadline. It had investor money that wasn't in deep pockets of money and they had a deadline they had to get to in order to remain solvent. And the engineers are holding them hostage and saying, we're going to walk away and your project won't get done unless you give us more money. Well, this is a problem with this kind of basic model where it's all about money. And we can hold you up for more money because we don't really care about the mission of the company, and we don't really care about our job. We're just in it for the money. And how you solve that problem, basically, is unfortunately going to be that you can't do it with simple contracts, you're going to have to do other things as well, and we'll come back to that in just a couple minutes. But the basic idea about incentives is the solution to the agency problem, as it's usually described, you're trying to reward people for doing the right thing. You want them to finish this project, they get paid so much when they finish a project. Think about it almost like a contractor, right? Now, there's a couple of other ideas around this simple model. One of them is something that economists call efficiency wages, and the idea here is kind of about relative competition. That if you pay more than your competitors, even if it's only a little bit more, you will get better workers, first of all, because if they can choose where to go, the best ones will come to you if you pay a little premium over everybody else. The second factor is that those folks are less likely to quit because where are they going to go if your job is better than everybody else's. And the third is, they're likely to behave better. Because if they don't, they might get fired and they'd lose a job which is better than everybody else's job. So basically, it's the advantages of having a job that on balance is better than the ones your competitors have got. And there's pretty clear evidence on that. I did one of these studies a while ago showing that discipline rates were actually lower at plants where companies were paying a little premium above the market rate. Now you've got to pay more for that, but the idea is because you're paying a little better than everybody else you get lots of benefits. Now the obvious question is what happens if everybody else starts paying more, and then the benefits go away, right. So it's all about relative competition, and the idea of a tournament as a way to structure pay is another kind of economics based argument that is about relative compensation, and this mimics the way sports tournaments work. So for example if you're a golfer or somebody playing an individual sport, you know that if you win the tournament, you get a big prize. The people coming in second get something that's pretty good. The third, you get a little trophy, and fourth place, you get a carry-on bag, and that's about it as you work your way down. The big prizes are for winning. Now why is that a good thing? Because you can have many people playing in the tournament all motivated by that one prize. And that makes it a very efficient way to do things. And there of course are downsides to this as well. And the downsides are that this works great in a tournament where nobody's gotta work together and everybody's literally competing against each other. But inside an organization, where these tournament models are set up, they're usually promotion systems. So if you get promoted to partner, you make a ton more than the people who are associates. If you get promoted to the next level up in a company, particularly to the CEO level, you make a ton more money than the people just below you. It motivates lots of people along the way, but if you want people to cooperate and work together in a company or in a professional service firm, it cuts against that. It creates incentives for you to fight each other, and it also creates incentives for you to join weak tournaments, that is you don't necessarily be in a tournament full of stars because it's going to be hard to win. You want to be in a tournament with a lot of losers because then it's easier for you to win. So, it affects where people want to go as well. Pluses and minuses to efficiency wages, pluses and minuses to tournaments.
