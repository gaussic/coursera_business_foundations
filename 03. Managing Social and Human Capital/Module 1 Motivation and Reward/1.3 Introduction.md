## Coursera 商业基础课程《管理社会与人力资本》 - 模块1 - 动机与激励

### 课程1.3 人力资源管理简介

聚焦于**人力资源管理中的法律与社会规范约束**，强调管理者需在合法性与公平性原则下设计激励、招聘与绩效管理体系，并适应全球化背景下的多元文化环境。

#### 1. 人力资源管理的基本约束

- **法律限制**：  
  - **反歧视法规**：在多数国家（如美国、欧盟），禁止基于性别、种族、宗教、年龄（如美国40岁以上）等「受保护群体」的歧视性雇佣行为（招聘、薪酬、晋升、裁员等）。  
  - **举证责任**：若雇佣决策对受保护群体产生负面影响（如裁员中女性比例过高），企业需证明决策基于客观标准（如绩效），而非主观偏见。  
- **社会规范约束**：  
  - **公平性原则**：公众对企业领导者的道德期待超越法律要求。即使不违法，不公平对待员工（如薪资不透明、晋升偏袒）仍会损害企业声誉与员工信任。

#### 2. 全球环境下的管理挑战

- **法律差异**：美国对雇主相对友好（管理自由度较高），但其他国家（如欧盟）对员工权利保护更严格（如工会权利、解雇限制）。  
- **文化适应性**：管理实践需适应不同国家的法律框架与社会价值观（如集体主义文化中更强调员工福利与长期雇佣）。

#### 3. 员工与供应商的本质区别

- **权利差异**：员工享有法定权利（如工会谈判权、反歧视保护），而供应商关系以合同条款为主，管理者对员工的控制权受法律严格限制。  
- **管理复杂性**：员工是「人」而非「生产要素」，需兼顾效率与人性化（如激励设计需平衡绩效目标与员工心理需求）。

#### 4. 实践启示

- **合规优先**：  
  - 建立标准化招聘与绩效评估流程（如结构化面试、量化绩效指标），确保决策可追溯且符合反歧视法规。  
  - 定期进行法律合规培训，避免隐性偏见（如无意识的年龄或性别偏好）。  

- **公平透明**：  
  - 薪酬与晋升政策需公开透明（如薪酬带宽制度、晋升标准公示），减少员工对不公平的感知。  
  - 通过匿名反馈机制（如员工满意度调查）监控组织内部公平性。  

- **全球化管理策略**：  
  - 在跨国运营中，采用「核心原则统一+本地化适配」模式（如全球绩效标准结合地区福利政策）。  
  - 关注当地工会力量与社会舆论（如欧洲国家需提前协商重大裁员决策）。  

- **人性化设计**：  
  - 避免将员工视为「可替换资源」，通过职业发展计划（如轮岗、培训）增强归属感。  
  - 在合法框架内赋予员工自主权（如弹性工作制），提升内在动机。

#### 总结

人力资源管理需在**法律底线、社会公平与组织效率**间取得平衡。管理者应：  
- **规避法律风险**：通过标准化流程与客观指标降低歧视争议。  
- **塑造公平文化**：以透明化与员工参与增强信任。  
- **灵活适应环境**：全球化背景下兼顾统一性与本地化需求。  
- **以人为本**：超越「工具化」思维，通过权利尊重与机会赋予激发员工潜能。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Motivation and Reward

引言：In this module, you'll learn how motivation affects an individual's performance and how to use that motivation to drive performance. You'll explore how incentive systems are designed and how psychological concepts such as behavior modification, imitation, conformity, and compliance influence and shape these systems. You’ll also examine the current process of hiring employees using technology, tracking systems, and outsourcing. And you’ll learn how you can provide valuable feedback to your employees, and make performance appraisals productive. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to apply what you've learned to best motivate, hire, and evaluate your employees.

#### 视频小节1：Introduction

字幕文本：

>> Hello folks, my name is Peter Cappelli and I'm a professor here at the Wharton School. I've been here for a long time.

When I first got here, there was a Republican president in office and it wasn't a Bush, so that gives you some sense of how long I've been here at the Wharton School. We're going to talk about managing human capital in this program. We're going to talk about a bunch of different parts of that that are fundamental, no matter where you are around the world, these issues play out in more or less the same way. We're going to start out talking about motivation, how to get people to do the kinds of things organizations or employers need them to do, how to reward people is a part of that. Hiring practices, how to do that the right way, managing performance and particularly, the issue of performance appraisals. We're going to talk about designing jobs, how to do a better job creating work that is meaningful and improves people's motivation. And work systems that improve performance, fit with the strategy of an organization and make everything better off. So that's the list of topics we're going to work our way through. We're going to start out with some thoughts about employment in general. That is, when you are hiring people, how do we think about that. The first thing to remember is we're talking about people here. Particularly for folks who have more of a technical orientation or an economics orientation, it's easy to think about factors of production and imagine that they're all the same. But they're not, were talking about employment, were talking about hiring and managing. We are talking about people and the reason that's different, just from a practical concern, is that people have legal rights. In most countries of the world, those rights include unionization, the ability to bargain with the employer and basically, it means force the employer to do things the employees want. The ability of management is not unlimited, depending where you are around the world, those legal restrictions can be quite constraining. The U.S. has, probably among the developed countries, the most favorable legal environment for employers.

They can do more things the way they want to do them than they could in other countries but even in the U.S., there are lots of constraints on what you can do. Most of the constraints have to do with discrimination against protected groups. In the U.S., you see this legislation in the European Union, other countries as well.

Basically, that means you can't discriminate against women, minorities, that means ethnic minorities, religious groups, people because of their religious orientation and in a lot of countries now, age. So that means in the U.S., people over 40, different countries, maybe a little higher. What that means in practice is that you can't take employment actions, hiring, pay, promotions, anything that affects people materially in ways that have a particular impact against those protected groups. And depending what country you're in, the burden is on you to prove that you're not doing that. If it turns out that most of the people laid off are women, for example, the burden on the employer is to show that that was done in a way that was fair and was not intended to be discriminatory and instead was based on something that was objective. In addition to laws, we have social norms that matter as well, And those norms are really ones concerning questions of fairness. And that means the leaders of businesses, political leaders of government, are held accountable to the way they treat their employees independent of whether they're violating the law. This is all by way of a caveat to the things that we're going to talk about. You don't have unlimited power as a manager, as an owner, the way you manage your people, the way you might with how you buy computers or how you assemble parts or something like that or deal with vendors. Employees are not vendors, usually, they're not contractors, they've got a bunch of different rights. Let's bear that in mind when we start talking about the important issues around managing people.
