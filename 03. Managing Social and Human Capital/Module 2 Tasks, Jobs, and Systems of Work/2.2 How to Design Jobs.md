## Coursera 商业基础课程《管理社会与人力资本》 - 模块2 - 任务、工作与工作系统

### 课程2.2 如何设计工作

以**泰勒科学管理理论**为核心，解析工业化时代工作设计的底层逻辑，揭示任务分解、标准化与效率驱动对现代工作系统的深远影响。

#### 1. 传统工厂的混乱与效率困境

- **20世纪初工厂现状**：  
  - **无序性**：零件堆积、工人流动率高（年流失率200%-300%）、外包工段各自为政。  
  - **低效根源**：  
    1. 任务边界模糊（如技工自行选择工具和方法）；  
    2. 缺乏流程追踪（需用标签跟踪零件流向）；  
    3. 非熟练工占比高，协作断裂。  

#### 2. 泰勒科学管理理论的革命性突破

- **核心原则**：  
  - **任务分解（Deskilling）**：  
    - 将复杂工作拆解为简单任务（如美发店案例：接待、洗发、剪发、吹干分离）。  
    - **目标**：高技能者专注核心任务（如发型师仅剪发），低技能者执行辅助任务，降低人力成本。  
  - **标准化流程**：  
    - **时间与动作研究**：通过摄影记录（如Muybridge的连续摄影技术）分析最优动作路径，制定标准操作。  
    - **消除自主性**：工程师定义「唯一正确方法」，工人按指令执行（如流水线固定工位）。  
  - **计件工资（Piece Rate）**：  
    - 按任务量支付报酬，将效率提升与工人收益绑定（如每组装一个零件获得固定酬劳）。  
- **历史意义**：  
  - **制造业效率飞跃**：福特流水线（T型车生产时间从12小时缩短至93分钟）验证其有效性。  
  - **全球扩散**：通过跨国公司（如福特）推广至欧洲、苏联等地，成为工业化标配。  

#### 3. 科学管理的双重影响 

- **优势**：  
  - **效率革命**：单位时间产出大幅提升，生产成本降低。  
  - **规模化复制**：标准化降低对个体技能的依赖，快速培训新工人。  
- **局限性**：  
  - **人性压抑**：工人沦为「机器延伸」（如卓别林《摩登时代》讽刺的机械重复）。  
  - **创新扼杀**：严格流程抑制改进动力（如丰田后来自主突破泰勒模式）。  
  - **适用边界**：仅适合重复性工作（如制造业），知识型工作（如研发）需灵活性。  

#### 4. 现代工作设计的启示

- **任务分工的演进**：  
  - **服务业应用**：快餐业（如麦当劳）沿用任务分解（炸薯条、收银、清洁独立岗位）。  
  - **数字化转型**：AI接管标准化任务（如客服机器人），人类聚焦决策与创意。  
- **弹性平衡**：  
  - **敏捷团队**：保留任务拆解逻辑（如Scrum中的Sprint任务），但赋予自主权（如自选工作方法）。  
  - **人本回归**：谷歌「20%自由时间」机制，在效率框架内保留创新空间。  

#### 5. 关键结论

1. **效率与人性需动态平衡**：泰勒主义奠定了现代管理基础，但需在标准化与员工自主性间寻找新平衡点。  
2. **技能分层仍是底层逻辑**：即使知识经济时代，「核心任务-辅助任务」分工模式（如高管-外包团队）依然普遍。  
3. **技术赋能新泰勒主义**：AI与数据分析使任务拆解更精细化（如Uber算法调度），但需规避「数字流水线」对人的异化。  
4. **文化适配性**：  
   - **制造业/服务业**：科学管理仍为主流（如特斯拉工厂）；  
   - **创新行业**：需去标准化（如硅谷「扁平化+项目制」）。

#### 总结  

泰勒的科学管理理论是工业化时代的「效率圣经」，其任务拆解与标准化逻辑至今仍是工作设计的DNA。然而，知识经济与人性化诉求推动工作系统向「柔性科学管理」演进——**用数据优化流程，以文化释放人性**，成为未来组织竞争力的关键。

### 第一章：Tasks, Jobs, and Systems of Work

#### 视频小节1：How to Design Jobs

字幕文本：

Now this question of how to design jobs maybe doesn't matter that much, if you're working by yourself, right? Say here's a problem over there, just go do it. You figure out how to get it done, something has to be put together, you do it. But once people start working together with other people, then the definition of jobs matters a lot because it affects how those people interact with each other, who does what.

Jobs are designed poorly. There may be tasks that aren't assigned to either one. And so you end up with problems, things just aren't being done. You might end up with jobs that are designed in such a way that one is causing problems for another, so it starts to become complicated then. We got a video I want you to see here. It's one of the earliest pieces of film available that looks at factory work. This I think is about from the year 1913, so take a look at how factory life functioned then. [MUSIC] >> The late 19th century factory was noisy, cluttered, and chaotic.

A collection of small workshops employing hundreds or even thousands of people under one roof.

Craftsmen like machinists and millwrights decided which tools were best for a particular job and how they should be used.

>> So what you saw in that factory is chaos, right? There's piles of parts all over the place. There are people having to climb over the parts in order to get to different parts of the factory. There's a lot of people standing around not doing anything in that particular factory. And there's some things that you couldn't observe, but I can tell you about how it worked. One of the reasons why it was so chaotic was because in early factories like that they actually outsourced a lot of stuff. So inside that building there were several workstations, and it's quite possible that each workstation was run by an independent contractor who hired their own people and did their own work, and didn't have much of anything to do with the team right next to them. The turnover of employees in a factory like this one would be enormous. So there might be turnover rates of 2 and 300%. You wonder how could they function like that? Well, at the very beginning of the video, you saw some people working with their hands, sawing stuff and hammering stuff. People doing some of that kind of work could just come in and out every day. You could have a different group tomorrow, it's not going to matter that much. The work wasn't skilled, it didn't have to fit together in any way. It's like working by yourself, really. The big problem though of this place was it was incredibly chaotic. It took a long time to get stuff done, and the ability to plan and even figure out what was going on was really difficult. In fact, the earliest engineers trying to figure this stuff out, what they would do is just put some tags on parts and try to follow them through the plant to see where they were going because no one really knew, they didn't even know how things flowed inside these organizations.

So one of the most important developments of the 20th century is an effort to figure this out. So the guy who tries to figure this out first, one of the most important developments of the 20th century were his efforts, is a guy named Frederick Winslow Taylor, who was a lecturer at the Wharton School, and his great patron was the CEO of Bethlehem Steel, a guy named Joseph Wharton. So Joseph Wharton brought Frederick Taylor to the Wharton School, but Frederick Taylor was a guy from Philadelphia, from son of a rich Quaker family. And it's a strange story, but he was on his way to an Ivy League education and he developed eye strain, or so they said. Probably some sort of stress related mental illness. And the doctors at the time prescribed manual work for him as a solution to his problem. So you could imagine this rich Ivy League sort of kid ends up in one of these factories. Well, he sides, obviously, with the owners of the factories in trying to figure out what the issues are. And for him the big problem was, why isn't this place more productive? Why is it that we can't get more done? And when you would ask the workers, particularly the lead workers, right, so there'd be a lot of people who were just lifting stuff and a few key workers who really knew how things were done. He'd ask them why can't you move faster? And they'd just blow him off and tell him you can't do it faster. And he just didn't believe that, right? So he undertook his life's work, which was to figure out how to reorganize factories in a way that would allow them to be more productive. Kind of a noble goal, but the way he ends up doing it becomes incredibly important for the way work is organized, not just in the US but then around the world. And interestingly, one of the biggest proponents of Frederick Taylor's methods was the Soviet Union where they really thought that he had done some terrific stuff. This was his idea, was to figure out how to design individual jobs, and what he really was thinking are the tasks performed in jobs in ways which are the easiest to do. So you might think about this in part as the first, maybe the earliest notion of ergonomics and that is, how do we design something simple like lifting heavy pieces of iron? Which was one of the things that he did first, in ways that is easiest for the workers to do, or another way to say it, so they could lift the most, right? So some of it was that. Another part of it, though, was to look at complicated jobs. So if you looked at what a machinist did, for example, working on a lathe or something like that, it's highly skilled work. And what he realized was that you could take that highly skilled work and you could break it down into a series of individual tasks. Some of those tasks actually weren't that hard to do, and maybe you could give those tasks to lower skilled workers. Now, what does this mean in practice? Well imagine this, you're going to get your hair cut and you go to a very small shop and there's only one person in there and that person is the stylist, right? So what happens when you walk in the door, they greet you, they ask you to sit down, they get things ready. Then they talk to you about what it is that you want done, and then they take you back, maybe, and wash your hair, they cut your hair, they blow your hair out. And at the end they take your money, maybe make another appointment for you, and out you go, right? That stylist is doing a bunch of separate tasks. Well, Frederick Taylor might go into that place and say there's a bunch of things the stylist is doing that don't require stylist skills. And if you went into a bigger shop here's what you'd find. You walk in the door, the person who meets you is not the stylist. It is a low skilled, low wage person who meets you at the door, asks you to sit down, find your name, figures out who's going to cut your hair that day.

And then the stylist maybe meets with you a couple minutes to find out what you want, say hello, etc. Somebody else, another person who's kind of low skilled, lower skilled and lower paid, takes you back and washes your hair and brings you back to the stylist, who then cuts your hair. And maybe somebody else at the end of it, blow drys your hair for you. And after that you go up to the front, you see the receptionist again, and then they take your money, make an appointment again, send you out the door. So what happens there, the stylist is only doing the work that requires a stylist's skills. Everything else has been hived off to lower skilled workers. So for the employer, why does this help? Well, let's say stylists get paid more money [LAUGH]. Now you're only paying the stylist for the skills, the tasks that use their skills, and you got a bunch of other people at lower wages doing the other work. So per haircut, now as a employer, as a company, it's costing you way less to do if you're the boss here because you're not having to pay as much for as much of the work that was done. So Frederick Taylor's ideas were kind of that. Some people call this deskilling. You take a job that was done by somebody with high skill and you break it up into a part that is high skill, but a lot of other parts that are kind of low skill. Now the second thing about Taylor's approach to this was he's telling everybody exactly how their job should be performed, and typically it was engineers that were doing this. They would figure out the best way for you to perform your job. Then they were telling you, here's how you've gotta do it. So you lost all control over this.

So the idea of time in motion studies, which were developed in part here at the University of Pennsylvania by a guy named Mirebridge who worked on stop action photography of people and how they moved. Could slow it down and see how people were performing tasks, how they actually did it. The idea of time and motion studies was like a stopwatch and a camera to watch how you performed your job. And to figure out, among other things, how long it took you to perform each task. And then they would hold people accountable for how many of those tasks they got done per hour because they had a standard now, that they were watching people, they could figure out sort of how much you could do. Now you could imagine what this does to you, if you went back to this factory image we just saw earlier. A lot of chaos, right? One thing you would see now is a lot of structure. You wouldn't see people walking around and performing different tasks in different places. You would be in one place, you weren't spending your time walking around, just performing that one task. You'd be doing it in a standard way, over and over and over, same way every time. You got consistency and you got efficiency from this. Now Taylor added one other piece, sort of what's in it for the workers? And that piece was payments that were designed to share the productivity gains with the workers. And his idea was piece rate, right? Piece rate means every time you perform this task, you made so much money, so you had an incentive to do more of these tasks, right? So that was his system. It was adopted first in manufacturing, but it really hit its stride with the rise of assembly lines, right? And assembly lines used the time and motion studies and Frederick Winslow Taylor's idea, which was called scientific management, to break down jobs into their simplest parts. You see this all around the world. It spreads across the world from US multi-national companies going abroad. Ford Motor Company in particular takes these techniques to Europe and to other countries, and from there they spread.
