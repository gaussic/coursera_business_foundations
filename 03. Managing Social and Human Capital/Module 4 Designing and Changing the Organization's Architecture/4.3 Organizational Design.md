## Coursera 商业基础课程《管理社会与人力资本》 - 模块4 - 组织架构设计与变革

### 课程4.3 组织架构的变革阻力与应对策略

聚焦**组织惯性对变革的阻碍**，结合John Kotter的**变革八项阻力模型**，揭示企业在市场变化（如全球化、数字化）中调整架构的挑战，并提出领导者在设计动态组织架构时的关键策略。

#### 1. 组织惯性的双重性

1. **惯性作为稳定器**  
   1. **正面作用**：成熟架构（如明确职责、高效流程）形成「飞轮效应」，实现自我运转（如Rose公司分权化后的自主管理）。  
   2. **管理者价值**：架构稳定期，管理者可减少干预（如案例中「周五休假」的比喻）。  

2. **惯性作为阻碍**  
   1. **市场错配风险**：当外部环境剧变（如全球化需开拓印度市场），既有架构无法适配新需求（如员工抗拒外派，招聘时未预见国际化需求）。  
   2. **案例：全球化扩张困境**  
      1. 原架构聚焦美国市场，员工未签约国际任务，导致新市场开拓时人才与文化适配困难。

#### 2. 变革失败的八大根源（Kotter模型）
视频结合案例重点强调以下阻力：  
1. **缺乏紧迫感（阻力1）**  
   1.  管理者未能用数据/危机案例证明变革必要性（如员工口头支持但行动照旧）。  
2. **愿景沟通不足（阻力3-4）**  
   1.  变革目标需**高频重复沟通**（如Rose公司多次强调分权化价值），初期易被质疑，需通过持续传递建立信任。  
3. **未清除障碍（阻力5）**  
   1.  未预判并解决变革成本（如员工培训、岗位调整的短期痛苦）。  
4. **文化脱节（阻力8）**  
   1.  变革未嵌入组织文化（如分权化需匹配「自主决策」文化，而非传统集权习惯）。  

**其他关键阻力**：  
- 未组建强力联盟（阻力2）  
- 缺乏短期胜利（阻力6）  
- 过早宣布成功（阻力7）  

#### 3. 应对策略与领导力行动

1. **打破惯性的三大杠杆**  
   1.  **制造危机感**：用竞争威胁/客户流失数据唤醒团队（如「若不全球化，市场份额将被蚕食」）。  
   2. **设计弹性架构**：预留灵活性（如轮岗制度、跨职能团队），减少架构僵化。  
   3. **文化先行**：将变革目标融入日常行为（如奖励创新试错，惩罚保守主义）。  

2. **Kotter模型的实践应用**  
   1. **步骤1：建立紧迫感**  
      1. 行动：发布市场趋势报告，对比竞争对手的全球化进展。  
   2. **步骤4：高频沟通愿景**  
      1. 行动：每周例会分享变革进展，用试点成功案例（如某区域分权化后效率提升20%）增强说服力。  
   3. **步骤6：创造短期胜利**  
      1. 行动：设定3个月里程碑（如完成印度团队组建），公开庆祝并奖励贡献者。  

3. **案例：Rose公司的分权化改革**  
   1. **挑战**：原职能型架构导致地方效率低下，总部集权抑制创新。  
   2. **策略**：  
      1. 将财务、运营等职能下放至区域，赋予区域经理全权责任。  
      2. 配套激励机制：区域利润增长与团队奖金直接挂钩。  
   3. **结果**：决策速度提升，市场响应能力增强。  

#### 4. 管理启示

1. **动态设计原则**  
   1. 每2-3年重新评估架构适配性（如审视汇报关系是否匹配战略重心）。  
2. **员工参与式变革**  
   1. 在架构调整中纳入一线反馈（如调研外派意愿，设计弹性职业路径）。  
3. **容忍试错成本**  
   1. 预留10-15%资源用于小规模试点（如新市场开拓前进行6个月区域性测试）。  

---

#### 关键结论

- **惯性管理**：善用惯性维持稳定，但需预设「架构弹性」应对突变。  
- **变革即沟通**：领导者70%精力应用于传递愿景，30%用于执行设计。  
- **文化 > 结构**：再完美的架构若脱离文化根基（如员工风险厌恶），终将失效。  

**行动号召**：定期以「外部视角」审视组织架构（如邀请客户/行业专家评估），将变革能力列为领导力核心考核指标。

## 模块标题：Week 4: Designing and Changing the Organization's Architecture

引言：

This module was created to describe the influence of an organization's architecture on management and its team's performance. You'll explore how inequity fosters disparity among employees and can inhibit a company's success. You'll also look at two real-world examples of leaders who tackled problems within their organizational structures to effect change. By the end of this module you will be able to identify key steps in which you can lead change within your organization.

Learning Objectives
- Estimate how inequity fosters disparity among employees and can inhibit a company's success.
- Compare David Pottruck and Charles Schwab's organizational structures.
- Select key steps as to how you can lead change in your organization.

### 第一章：Designing and Changing the Organization's Architecture

#### 视频小节3：Organizational Design

字幕文本：

Pulling several strands together of our last 20 or 25 minutes of thinking this through actually together, I'd like you to be thinking actively about your own management and work setting as we go forward of course. That organizational design along with the way we create jobs, the way we incentivize people, the organizational design, think the people at Hauser Foods, Jan Boyar in particular, can be altered, or misdirected, or align. Or maybe in the more positive sense, we can get a lot more. Pay no more, not really changing the job, but just the way we knit all these pieces together. How people report, how we promote up through a hierarchy, all part of the, just to use the phrase, of the design of the organization, the architecture of the enterprise. With that being said, here's the last problem I'd like us to think about in this general area of putting in place an organizational design that serves you.

Sometimes though what we have [LAUGH] serving us well, maybe even not perfectly a couple years ago may no longer do so.

And now we run into just a classic problem of organizational life. Everybody knows about it, I'm just going to say the blindingly obvious here. That as we solve a problem this year and build out, we hire people, build out a design, create jobs, provide an incentive system that seems to solve the problems of, let's say, last year. Go ahead five years, market changes, the Internet arrives, digital everything is here.

We've now got to serve customers in India and China, and not just the US. The problem we've got now is we've built an architecture which serves the problem of last year, or five years ago. And an architecture once constructed, add on a culture to go with it, a topic that another of my colleagues is going to take up, we now face the problem of call it inertial guidance. If you think about a big flywheel, just a big steel wheel that's turning. Once that gets turning, very hard to slow it down. It has a lot of inertial momentum to it.

And thus in a sense, once you got architecture going for you, as the manager, you can actually take off Fridays for a while [LAUGH] because it just kind of manages itself. That's inertial guidance. That's what good architecture does. But when the world changes, that architecture of yesteryear may no longer work so well. Now we've got just a huge impediment. That is just what we do, the flywheel rotating, the inertial momentum that's been built up that makes it difficult to change. To say the obvious, we've hired people because we're doing X, we're focused on the US. But now we want to open up in India, or let's make it Brazil. Well they didn't come to work for you because they thought one day they might be transferred to India. But now you need people to run the office New Delhi or Mumbai. And [LAUGH] if we start going down that particular avenue, the problems multiply quickly. If we don't make the change, aren't ready to have people take on these new tasks, but the people we hired, almost everything we do militates against that kind of change. Change is one of the great enemies of organizational design. So we're going to take a few minutes now and think briefly about what gets in the way of the design we've created. Such that as the manager, once we recognize what gets in the way, we can do something about it. So let's go right here to the work of a well known observer and consultant on organizational change. Again, what does that mean? We got a design, we want to make it better.

[SLIDE]
Why Organizational Change Often Does Not Work
1. Not sufficient urgency for the goal of the change (<75% of team ready for change).
2. A powerful coalition not yet created.
3. Little vision underpinning the change agenda (failing the 5-minute advocacy test).
4. Vision is not repeatedly and compellingly communicated.
5. Anticipated obstacles to the change not reduced or removed.
6. Too few shot-terms wins to sustain momentum.
7. Declaring victory prematurely.
8. Failing to anchor change agenda more broadly in company culture.

John Cotter has identified eight forces, just to pull them out and make them more managerially relevant, that seem to get in the way of making changes. So take a look at number 1 here, for instance. You, the manager, don't make a compelling case. Look everybody, we've got a change because the world's changing. And everybody salutes, great idea and goes back to work the way they've always done it. Let's go down to number 4. He has found, I've seen the same thing myself, that for people who are saying we've got to really just flatten the organization, put people more in touch with the customers. Maybe reorganize like we saw at that Rose Company making plants independently responsible for everything, that we have to say what we want again and again. Because the first time it's not believed, or it's questioned second and third time. It takes on a certain traction. And people are wondering, okay, boss, do you really want this? because the costs are going to be high making a change. So, that's the number 4.

Just briefly take a look, I'm not going to enumerate or expand out word-wise what the other six say.

But for our purposes right now, we're going to try to do an organizational restructuring or redesign. I'd like you to take a look at those eight factors.

Ask yourself which of those have you seen well executed maybe by yourself or others that you manage with. But get them much in mind because I want them to inform where we're going the next few minutes.
