### 课程4.4 Charles Schwab案例——颠覆性变革中的领导力与组织架构挑战

通过Charles Schwab公司CEO **David Pottruck** 的决策案例，探讨企业如何在**成功惯性**与**外部颠覆**的双重压力下，通过激进组织架构调整实现转型，并分析领导者面临的战略、执行与利益相关者管理挑战。

#### 1. 市场环境与内部危机

1. **外部威胁**  
   1. **互联网冲击**：纯线上券商（如E-Trade）以19美元低价争夺高频交易客户，威胁Schwab的折扣经纪模式。  
   2. **行业趋势**：投资者转向低成本、自助式交易，传统「全服务+高佣金」模式不可持续。  

2. **内部蚕食**  
   1. **客户套利**：客户通过保留全服务账户（80美元）获取研究报告，却在e.Schwab（29美元）执行交易，导致收入流失。  
   2. **数据警示**：尽管公司年收入增长24%、客户资产增长40%，但客户行为预示商业模式漏洞。  

#### 2. 激进变革的决策逻辑

1. **战略选择**  
   1. **价格与成本双降**：将全服务交易费从80美元降至29美元（降幅70%），同步削减70%运营成本（如客服资源优化、流程数字化）。  
   2. **目标**：  
      1. **短期**：阻止客户流向E-Trade等竞争对手。  
      2. **长期**：抢占线上交易市场份额，重塑行业领导者地位。  

2. **风险预判**  
   1. **财务冲击**：预计税前利润下降20-25%，股价可能暴跌（类比航空公司票价骤降70%后的收入断崖）。  
   2. **投资者压力**：股东因短期利润下滑可能抛售股票，质疑战略可行性。  

#### 3. 领导力挑战与行动策略

1. **对抗成功惯性**  
   1. **内部阻力**：员工与投资者满足于当前高增长（「别搞砸现有模式」的潜台词），抵触高风险变革。  
   2. **沟通策略**：  
      1. **高频传递紧迫性**：用客户流失数据与竞争对手增长案例唤醒团队（呼应Kotter模型「建立紧迫感」）。  
      2. **绑定长期愿景**：强调「成为线上投资服务领导者」而非短期利润。  

2. **利益相关者管理**  
   1. **董事会说服**：需与创始人Charles Schwab达成共识，直面短期阵痛（案例隐含关键对话）。  
   2. **投资者预期引导**：提前沟通「以市场份额换长期价值」的逻辑，淡化季度利润指标。  

3. **组织架构调整**  
   1. **整合业务线**：消除全服务与e.Schwab的割裂，防止内部资源竞争（如统一账户权限，按交易量分级定价）。  
   2. **成本重构**：通过AI客服、自动化报告降低人工依赖，支撑低价模式可持续性。  

#### 4. 管理启示与行动框架

1. **颠覆性变革的时机**  
   1. **前瞻性颠覆**：在危机显现前行动（如David预判而非被动响应），避免「温水煮青蛙」效应。  
   2. **容忍短期牺牲**：接受利润下滑以换取市场主导权（参考亚马逊长期低利润扩张策略）。  

2. **架构弹性设计**  
   1. **动态扫描机制**：定期评估外部威胁（如技术变革、竞争格局），预设架构调整预案。  
   2. **文化适配**：将「敏捷响应」嵌入组织DNA（如奖励创新试错，轮岗培养全局视野）。  

3. **变革领导力核心**  
   1. **数据与直觉平衡**：在财务乐观期，依赖行业洞察力而非单纯报表决策。  
   2. **自上而下推动**：CEO需直接主导变革联盟，避免中层妥协稀释战略（如David仅与直接下属沟通，保留最终决策权）。 

#### 关键结论 

1. **不颠覆则被颠覆**：数字化时代，组织架构必须具备「自我革命」能力，防止成功经验成为转型枷锁。  
2. **领导者的悖论**：需在数据乐观期推动高风险变革，依赖直觉与远见平衡短期利益与长期生存。  
3. **系统性成本革命**：价格战背后是成本架构的重塑，仅靠降价无配套效率提升将加速衰败。

**案例延伸思考**：  
- **结果验证**（课程未提及）：历史上Schwab通过此变革巩固了市场地位，2000年后成为线上投资服务巨头，印证了David的前瞻性。  
- **对比参考**：类似决策如Netflix从DVD邮寄转向流媒体，均体现「壮士断腕」式架构调整的必要性。  

**行动号召**：企业需建立「持续扫描-快速试错-果断执行」的变革机制，将架构灵活性列为战略核心能力。

### 第一章：Designing and Changing the Organization's Architecture

#### 视频小节4：David Pottruck and Charles Schwab Example

字幕文本：

Let's go very briefly out to San Francisco and we see there the chief executive of a company, I think we all know it because there are many ads that asked us to talk with Chuck Charles Schwab, a very, very large what's called discount retail broker.

Most famous company historically in this category is Merrill Lynch. To make it straightforward, if you wanted to buy 1,000 shares of let's make it Cisco, can't call up the New York Stock Exchange to acquire the shares. You call up Merrill Lynch. I want 1,000 shares. Merrill says, great.

[SLIDE]
Trade Service
- $80 Full service (research, recommendations, products)
- $29 e.Schwab (1 call per month; no CSRs)
Robust annual growth
- Revenues: 24% during past 4 years
- Net income: 23% during past 4 years
- Customer assets: 42% during past 7 years
- Stock price: doubled during past year
- 1.2 million online accounts
Super-discounters
- Ameritrade and E*Trade and 60 other firms offering online trading
  - Heavy traders migrating to super-discount brokers (80% from 20%)
Company culture: Technology driven, innovative products, early mover

David Pottruck decides that Schwab move to full service
trading at $29.
Adverse consequences forecast: $100 million reduction in
pre-tax net profits (22% of total); stock price will plummet.
How should he manage the organization change?
[SLIDE]

At that time, cost to rent $129. Charles Schwab is a discount broker offering the same services, more efficient. A little bit like Walmart that offers high quality goods given the price point they're at very well. But they're not a high end retail store. They do something different. That's what retail brokerage here is. They're providing service that is full but more efficiently and less expensively. Such that Schwab can charge $80 for a 1,000 share purchase of a given stock. At the time David Pottruck, gentleman on the right, Chief Executive Officer, Charles Schwab himself is the Executive Chair which means he comes to work every day as a big voice at the table. But so much day to day action with 15,000 employees goes through this manager that we're looking at, David Pottruck, in his office in San Francisco. And what David has [LAUGH] begun to mull over is the fact that he had advocated that Schwab develop at that time a very simple Internet service where you can go on is called e.Schwab. Order 1,000 shares of make a Cisco and because it's the Internet now, $29. Well, who doesn't want to pay 29 when you could have paid 80? Of course, there's less there, and as the business model, if it's e.Schwab where you buy your shares, you can talk to one of the customer service experts per month.

Now, if you're a full service costumer at $80, you can call him up 8 times today and I'll take the call and give you some guidance. So a little bit less expensive, quite a bit less expensive, and less service. There's a logic to that.

David Pottruck, excellent manager that he is, is acutely sensitive about a past function that he has performed.

He comes out of marketing, is in touch with a lot of customers as a result. Always a good idea for anybody, regardless of the kind of organization and he's hearing this. Customers are saying, David, we've got a problem because with e.Schwab we'd love to save the money about a 70% discount over $80 and you're better than some of the competition of the high end. That's true but since you've already got your customer service representatives well trained, they're expert they pull out reports, why can't we talk to more? Why can't we at least read their research?

And David says, well look, if you want the full service you gotta pay $80, that's our business model.

Well, some of the customers are saying but it says Schwab in both programs. Aren't you one company?

Even more worrisome is this. Most people don't see it. David's already spotted it because he's a very analytic guy, he works the numbers. He sees that some of the customers, clever people they are, or keeping open a full service account leaving a few dollars in it, moving $995,000 into the e.Schwab account where they're doing their active trading. They got it both ways. Full service, they can talk to a customer service representative. They can get all the reports, but then they use that information to trade actively at $29. Just to borrow a well known phrase, we've got [LAUGH] cannibalism but in this case it's internal. It's not somebody eating us out from the outside as happened for example to eBay in China was really attacked directly by Alibaba, in this case we got a problem on the end side, we're cannibalizing ourselves. David turns around though and being mindful not explicitly with the eight factors they can get in a way of organizational redesign.

Knows or as concluded that this company has to make a radical change. Or somebody else is going to change the company and in particular now he's worried about a bunch of young upstarts, companies that got names like E-Trade, that are full online traders, there's no bricks and mortar to go with them. And they're offering trades often at $19 a trade. Not much research. Not much behind it. But for people who are thinking about keeping a few dollars in a Schwab account, why not even go over to E-Trade. Sooner or later, with the boom of the Internet it's going to change everything as we know so well. David figures we're going to be out of business. Unfortunately, being mindful now of the factors on a prior image, he's also thinking, wow, nobody's going to want to change here because I've looked at the numbers for the last four years and we've been doing extremely well.

This goes back to an earlier idea on good and timely decision making. When we're doing well, we tend to become more sub optimal in how we think about decisions. Well, David is saying, we got that problem now. We're getting 24% year on year growth in revenue. Customer assets are up 40% in the last year.

Everybody is thinking, we got a great business model, don't foul it up they would say privately. Since David's Chief Executive, they probably won't say that to his face.

With that being said, let's move it on now, and I'm going to ask you to think ever so briefly after you've decided your David Pottruck, gentleman in the middle of the screen, Chuck Schwab, Charles Schwab his boss to his right, both smiling. Before you say what you're about to say, Chuck is smiling because you've decided that this company has to go from $80 full service overnight on 1 day down to $29 full service. You've gotta take your product you're selling, and now imagine an airline discounting a seat from New York to Los Angeles by 70%. That's going to be a huge draw for customers, it's also going to be a huge hemorrhage in terms of money coming in. Keep that in mind.

David Pottruck decides, literally, in the privacy of his office, he talks to his direct reports, about a dozen people that report directly to him as Chief Executive, he decides, tells them, informs them, ask for their guidance, of course, on how to enact the decision. He says, everybody, January 15th of the coming year, we're going to have to cut our service costs, we're going to have to cut the price of the service by 70%, got to cut our costs as well obviously by 70%. Imagine if American Airlines cut by 70% the cost of a seat from New York City to Los Angeles. Well, there be a boom in air travelers of course. Everybody can see that's a great attraction. On the other hand, you got 70% less revenue coming in to hire a pilot and put gas in the aircraft. So you're going to have to think about this on both sides. Even worse, when it comes to the way the world works,

if you're a publicly traded enterprise and everybody's got a kind of a public to worry about even if you're not publicly traded, publicly traded companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.

I have a particular problem and that is investors have come into you for what you've been doing and not necessarily where you want to go.

And thus, David concludes that as they go to a 70% discounted full service trade, $29 per trade, January 15th the following year that the equity analysts that appraise companies. The big investors, some of the big pension funds, for example, that invest in companies, aren't going to have any confidence that this 70% cost or loss of income is somehow going to be made up for by the move that David has made. And as a result of that David Pottruck forecasts that the pretax drop in profits will be at least 20%, let's make it Apple if Apple takes a 20% sudden drop in its after tax profitability, the market's going to have a lot of negative reaction on that David forecasted as it turns out correctly here to be about 20 to 25%. The day he announced it in January 15th full trade, going to be a lot of seller orders going out. Companies investors are stampeding to get out of the stock.

So he sits down and let's think about now the art of managing, that's our topic, managing people, he sits down with probably the most important person he has to manage. Oddly, his boss.
