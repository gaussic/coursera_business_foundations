### **Coursera《管理人力与社会资本》Week 1: 动机与奖励（模块1-激励系统设计）总结与关键结论**

---

#### **核心主题**  
探讨**激励系统的复杂性与多维度设计**，结合经济学与心理学理论，揭示如何通过科学模型（如期望理论、从众效应、认知失调）优化员工行为，避免激励错位与短期主义。

---

### **关键内容提炼**

#### **1. 激励系统的核心矛盾**  
• **可控性与目标错位**：  
  • **员工视角**：激励需绑定个人可控的成果（如销售指标），但过度聚焦单一指标（如销量）可能导致牺牲企业长期利益（如低价倾销损害利润）。  
  • **组织视角**：高管激励（如股票期权）易引发短期行为（如财务造假、削减研发投入），因高管对股价影响有限且任期有限。  
  • **案例**：销售员为完成指标降价促销 → 销量达标但利润率下降 → 企业整体利润受损。  

#### **2. 经济学激励模型的局限性**  
• **代理理论（Agency Theory）**：  
  • **假设缺陷**：仅通过契约绑定利益（如绩效奖金）无法解决员工内在动机（如使命感）缺失问题。  
  • **案例**：高管为短期股价上涨削减长期投资 → 激励设计未平衡“股东回报”与“可持续发展”。  
• **效率工资与锦标赛理论**：  
  • **适用边界**：适用于可量化、独立性强的工作（如销售竞赛），但破坏团队协作（如研发部门竞争导致信息封锁）。  

#### **3. 心理学驱动的激励模型**  
• **期望理论（Expectancy Theory）**：  
  • **核心**：员工需明确感知“努力→绩效→奖励”的可靠链条。若信任缺失（如企业频繁变更奖金规则），激励失效。  
  • **应用**：设定透明、稳定的奖励机制（如季度奖金公开计算公式）。  
• **路径-目标理论（Path-Goal Theory）**：  
  • **核心**：员工需具备达成目标的技能与资源，否则激励无效。  
  • **案例**：程序员若无算法培训，高额奖金无法驱动其完成复杂任务。  
• **行为矫正（Behavior Modification）**：  
  • **随机奖励效应**：不定期发放即时奖励（如“现场红包”）比固定奖金更有效，因触发潜意识行为强化（如实验中的鸽子随机投食实验）。  
  • **应用**：零售业店长随机表彰优秀服务行为，强化员工自发积极性。  

#### **4. 社会心理学与群体效应**  
• **从众（Conformity）**：  
  • **电梯实验启示**：新员工易模仿团队主流行为。将低绩效者与高绩效团队共事，可自然提升其表现（如亚马逊“影子计划”）。  
• **模仿（Imitation）**：  
  • **角色模型力量**：员工模仿权威或魅力领导者（如乔布斯对苹果工程师的影响）。需警惕负面模仿（如高管违规行为被效仿）。  
• **服从（Compliance）**：  
  • **权威效应**：员工易盲从权威指令（如米尔格拉姆电击实验）。需确保管理者指令符合伦理（如微软取消“stack ranking”强制排名制度）。  

#### **5. 认知失调与自我驱动**  
• **目标设定理论**：  
  • **公开承诺**：员工公开承诺目标（如戒烟誓言）后，因认知失调（“自我形象”与“行为”冲突）更易坚持。  
  • **应用**：OKR（目标与关键成果）公开化，增强责任感。  
• **毕马龙效应（Pygmalion Effect）**：  
  • **高期待驱动高表现**：管理者传递高期望可提升员工自信与绩效（如教师对学生“潜力标签”的影响）。  
• **公平理论（Equity Theory）**：  
  • **感知公平**：员工不满薪资不公时会消极抵抗（如减少工作量）。需确保薪酬透明与内部公平（如Buffer公司公开全员薪资）。  

---

### **实践启示**  
1. **混合激励设计**：  
   • **基层员工**：以可控短期目标为主（如销售提成），辅以随机即时奖励（如客户好评奖金）。  
   • **高管层**：绑定长期股权（如5年解锁期）+ ESG（环境、社会、治理）绩效指标，平衡短期与长期利益。  

2. **文化塑造优于规则管控**：  
   • 通过高绩效团队氛围（从众效应）和榜样领导（模仿效应）替代复杂监管制度。  
   • 案例：Zappos取消职位等级，以“文化契合度”作为晋升核心标准。  

3. **技能与激励同步**：  
   • 提供培训资源（路径-目标理论）确保员工有能力达成激励目标（如谷歌“20%自由时间”配套创新方法论课程）。  

4. **透明与信任机制**：  
   • 定期沟通激励规则（期望理论），避免政策频繁变动削弱信任。  
   • 案例：Patagonia公开可持续发展目标进展，增强员工使命感。  

---

### **总结**  
• **激励是系统工程**：需融合经济学目标绑定与心理学行为洞察，兼顾可控性、公平性、长期性。  
• **人性化设计**：超越“控制-奖励”思维，通过文化、信任、技能赋能激发内在动机。  
• **动态校准**：定期评估激励副作用（如短视行为），灵活调整以适应组织战略与外部环境变化。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Motivation and Reward

引言：In this module, you'll learn how motivation affects an individual's performance and how to use that motivation to drive performance. You'll explore how incentive systems are designed and how psychological concepts such as behavior modification, imitation, conformity, and compliance influence and shape these systems. You’ll also examine the current process of hiring employees using technology, tracking systems, and outsourcing. And you’ll learn how you can provide valuable feedback to your employees, and make performance appraisals productive. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to apply what you've learned to best motivate, hire, and evaluate your employees.

### 第二章：Module 1

#### 视频小节4：Designing Incentive Systems

字幕文本：

More generally when we talk about incentive systems, there's a tradeoff. And the tradeoff is going to be for employees. Ideally, you want an incentive system to be based on some measure of outcome that is within my control. So, something about my job. I do this, I get that.

If you don't have that, there's really no incentive. I can't control how much I'm going to get from you,

then there's no incentive for me to go do a good job. I might do a good job anyway, because I'm a good guy, but it's not because of the incentive. And the problem in lots of jobs is, it's very difficult to measure my output. If I work at administration, for example, or I work in a team, or I work in some context where I'm interdependent with people or with idiosyncratic problems. Its very difficult to measure my individual output. So another possibility would be to say well, let's make the output something big like overall firm goal, or overall organization performance. The problem with that is, it's beyond my ability to control that.

And the problem with doing that is, that I don't feel any incentive. So if you give me, for example, stock options, and I work in a huge corporation, I've got almost zero input into what happens to the share price. So I don't really have any incentive. There may be other reasons for me to have incentives, makes me feel part of the organization, but it's not the incentive from those rewards that is making me perform a particular way.

Well, how about having that organizational goal anyway? Well, the other problem with having goals that are maybe within my control, even if they're pretty far up, is that it's possible for me to do well at my goal, at the expense of the overall business. So, for example, if I'm a salesperson, and you say, we want you to sell more stuff.

I could sell a lot of stuff by giving customers a really sweet deal, that's giving them low prices, I could sell a lot of stuff and drive my performance up and my incentive pay up. So the problem with that is, sub-optimization. I'm doing well on my goal, but it's at the expense of the overall business. So it's another example of rewarding A while hoping for B. So the best solution about most incentive based pay, is to not to rely on it too much and to have incentives that are pretty simple. So, if you try to design an incentive system that heads off every incentive to cheat and every possible way somebody might go bad with this, you're going to have to have a rule book that people will have to look up to decide what to do at work all the time. And you really don't want that. Now, the one exception we see for incentive based pay, is at the executive level, and for people whose individual jobs we believe drive the entire performance of the organization. And you might be able to tie their pay to overall business outcomes in a way that wouldn't make sense for lower employees, because they got no control, really, over the company's overall share price, or overall performance, the agency's performance.

But even here you could get sub-optimization. We get executives, for example, whose incentive pay is based on relatively short term performance. And then, there's a concern that they are driving up the short term performance of the firm at the expense of longer term performance where they're not going to be around. So it's really hard to get away from these problems of incentives. And so, the idea that we can simply manage people by incentives is unfortunately just not true.

Now, let's talk about more complicated models of management. These are ones that are developed by psychologist. So you might think about this. These are more realistic models of how people actually behave, but it's much more complicated to understand all these different affects, and to also think about how they might be bundled together in any given way of managing people. So let's start with this psychologist take on the agency theory story of economists. The incentive story. We want somebody to behave in a particular way, let's pay him if they achieved that. Well, the psychologists added a wrinkle to this, which they call expectancy theory. Psychologists have a way of calling whatever they do, theory, and so you'll hear that a lot through this program. Expectancy theory basically means, well, what do I actually expect from the employer? And that might be this, if I have got this incentive based plan. But I don't trust that, if I actually get the performance, that I will really get the reward. Then, my motivation falls, boom, to zero. So it's important to have predictability and trust in these models. You can't just hand somebody a contract and expect that that's going to make it work.

And if you believe that something might happen, change in ownership, change goals, change in compensation structure, then your motivations erodes. Another complication created by a different set of psychologists, this one, particularly, by our former warden, colleague Bob House, is something called, path-goal theory. And path-goal theory says, you can have all the incentives in the world and you could even have a clear goal for people that's unambiguous. But if they don't know how to get there, the incentives aren't going to do you any good. So, for example, if you ask me to do something at work that's kind of complicated, solve some particular algorithm or something, and here's the reward I get if I do it, but I don't know how to do that kind of math, all the motivation in the world is not going to matter much. So it reminds us of the importance of people having the skills, having the training, understanding what to do. It's not just about incentives.

The third issue, which is where we depart from the economists all together, begins with a series of, what we might call, cognitive models, that have to do with the way your brain processes information. And the simplest one of these is, behavior modification. An employer or a supervisor, let's say, who goes around a retail store and sees somebody doing good stuff, and gives them a spot bonus right there.

That's a kind of behavior modification technique. I got a spot bonus for behaving this way, I start to anticipate that maybe I will get more bonuses if I continue to act that way. But the beauty behavior modification is that you don't have to get those bonuses all the time. In fact, some of the strongest motivation, strongest learning about how to behave about a particular way about this, comes when you don't get them all the time, when you get them almost kind of randomly for doing the right thing.

And it teaches people to behave in a particular way, which is unconscious. It might look like incentives, but the difference with incentives is, you gotta know it's coming. Somebody's got to tell you, do this and you get the bonus. With behavior modification, you don't know it's coming, and you don't know when you're going to get it. And it causes you to learn in a different way, which is not at the conscious level. Let's talk about some other ways in which we can manage people to get them to perform the ways we want them to perform. And these are also of that kind of cognitive variety. These are associated with social psychology, and that is, how people behave in the context of other people. Now, maybe the simplest one of these is the notion of conformity, and that is, particularly, when there is uncertainty, we look around to other people to see how we should behave. I've got a little video clip on this one, as well, so look at this and watch what you see the people doing in this video.

>> The gentleman in the elevator now is candid. These folks who are entering, the man with the white shirt, the lady with the trench coat, and subsequently one other member of our staff, will face the rear. And you'll see, how this man in the trench coat- >> [LAUGH] >> Tries to maintain his individuality, little by a little. >> [LAUGH] >> He looks at his watch, but he's really making an excuse for turning just a little bit more to the wall. Now, we'll try it once again.

Here's the candid subject. Here comes the Candid Camera staff, three of them at least, and this man has apparently been in group. >> [LAUGH]
Play video starting at :9:51 and follow transcript9:51
>> Here's a fella with his hat on in front of the elevator.

First, he makes a full turn to the rear and Charlie closes the door.

A moment later, we'll open the door, everybody's changed positions. >> [LAUGH]

>> Now, we'll see if we can use group pressure for some good. Now, in a moment, on Charlie's signal, everybody turns forward. Meredith, notice, they take off their hats. >> [LAUGH] >> And now, do you think we could reverse the procedure? Watch.

>> [LAUGH] >> And what you see here is, as soon as the people in the subjects of this particular study, see how other people are behaving, one person, two people gets much more persuasive, three people, especially, persuasive. They conform to what that group is apparently doing. Now, how do you use this in the workplace? When you hire people into an organization, they don't know how it works, they do not know what the rules are. You put them in with a group of people, who are your high performing people, and they'll copy those people. If you have got somebody who is not doing particularly well, maybe for a little while you can put them into a group where everybody is doing the right thing, and they start to conform to the norms of the group. Two other ways to which some things similar works. One, is imitation. Imitation is different than conformity, think, role models with imitation. Somebody who has power over you, like maybe a teacher. And somebody who is attractive in various ways, that is, they are what you would hope to be. Now, we find ourselves copying those people, that's why we worry about role models for children, especially athletes, actors, people who are in the public eye and are doing glamorous things, because young people copy them. Same thing happens in the work place. If you've got a supervisor, let's say, got power over you, but somebody who is attractive to you in various ways, has what you would want. And they're doing the right kind of things at work, you're likely to copy that person. That's good for the organization. If you've got somebody who's attractive, has some power over you and they're not doing the right things, people are going to copy that person as well, which is a bad thing. And compliance is the idea that we really react to formal authority and the trappings of authority very powerfully. The famous studies, in this regard, were done by Stanley Milgrim, in the 1950s, showing how people will follow the orders of an authority figure in a medical context, somebody with a white lab coat and clipboard. Telling you, in that case, to provide electric shocks, and what they were told was a behavior modification study, but it actually was a study in compliance, to see how far people would go shocking somebody simply because an authority figure told them to it. So, we have a lot of power that is attributed to people who have authority over us. And we tend to do what they say. And so, we need to pay attention to that as well. We want our authority figures in organizations to be doing the right stuff because if they give people orders, we tend to follow them. And the last set of issues, or theories, or models that affect motivation, all have a common root. And the common root is something called cognitive dissonance. And that means, for psychologists who cooked this idea up, in our heads it's very difficult for us to hold conflicting pieces of evidence at the same time, conflicting thoughts about the same thing. So, for example, if you've got a kid who you really adore, and you think the kid is just wonderful, the teacher tells you that your kid is a big problem in school. Initial response is cognitive dissonance, and that means two inconsistent things. My kid, I know, is wonderful, teacher's telling me the kid's a jerk, how do we deal with that? That's the unpleasantness. And in our head, we don't like to hold that, so we resolve it in various kinds of ways. One of the ways in which me might resolve cognitive dissonance plays out in something called goal setting The importance of setting goals in organizations or in personal life. If you think, for example, about the models of quitting smoking or other sorts of behavior like that, they typically involve you making a promise. But the promise is often to other people you care about, like to your children. Saying, I understand that smoking is killing me and I promise you, I'm going to quit.

And you give them that letter and they know you've made that promise. And then comes the moment soon after that when you want a cigarette, what do you do? Now, they're not around, they're not going to see you do it. So you could sneak away and do it. The problem is, how do you feel about yourself at that point? I promised my kid I would do this. I don't think of myself as a liar, and yet, I'm going to be doing something which is, basically, lying to my kids. The resistance to doing that is because of this goal that you have set, and the difficulty of having cognitive dissonance. I think I'm a good person, yet, I'm about to violate my promise to my kids. That's unpleasant. I don't do it.

Another example of this is something known as the Pygmalion effect. Plays out a very similar way. It's from the Greek myth and the George Bernard Shaw play, and then the Disney Broadway movie, My Fair Lady. The idea that you can shape people's behavior by what you expect of them. And the Pygmalion effect says, if you are one of these people, especially, who's a role model, and you convey to the students or the people you supervise, high expectations for them, it affects about how they think about themselves and it affects their performance. So if you set higher goals for them and higher expectations, rather, for them, they are inclined to achieve more. Why? Because they believe that they can do it. They might say, gee, I don't think I can finish this race but the coach tells me I can, and she believes I can do it, therefore, I go back and push a little bit harder. So that's how the Pygmalion effect works. A third example of this, which my colleague Mike going to talk more about later, is equity theory, and this has to do with unfairness issues. When we perceive something is unfair, it creates a similar problem in our head, and we act in ways that try to create equity by changing the balance of our contributions. If we believe something's unfair, maybe we try to make it fair, say, by not working as hard. You're going to hear more about that one a little later.
