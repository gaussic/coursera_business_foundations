### 核心总结与关键结论

#### **课程背景与教授介绍**
1. **教授背景**  
   - Peter Cappelli（人力资源研究中心主任）与Mike Useem（领导力与变革中心主任）均为沃顿商学院资深教授，拥有数十年教学与企业研究经验。  
   - 研究领域涵盖中国、印度企业管理实践，聚焦CEO领导力与组织管理。  
   - 长期关注企业如何通过有效管理实现员工激励与高绩效。

2. **课程历史渊源**  
   - 沃顿商学院是管理学科的起源地之一，课程理论体系融合了科学管理、人际关系学派及现代团队管理思想：  
     - **科学管理（泰勒主义）**：强调效率与理性激励（如Frederick Taylor在沃顿的贡献）。  
     - **人际关系学派（Elton Mayo）**：发现员工非完全理性，群体动态对绩效影响显著。  
     - **现代管理思想**：引用Stanley McChrystal《团队中的团队》（团队协作）、Cheryl Sandberg《向前一步》（职场影响力）等案例。

#### **Week 1核心内容：动机与激励**
1. **动机驱动绩效**  
   - 员工行为受内在动机（如成就感）与外在激励（如薪酬）共同影响。  
   - 管理者需理解个体差异，设计个性化激励方案。

2. **激励系统设计原则**  
   - **行为修正理论**：通过正向强化（奖励）或负向强化（惩罚）塑造行为。  
   - **社会学习（模仿与从众）**：员工通过观察他人行为调整自身行动，管理者需营造积极榜样文化。  
   - **合规性管理**：通过制度与规范确保员工行为符合组织目标。

3. **现代招聘与评估**  
   - **技术应用**：AI筛选、数据分析、外包等提升招聘效率，但需平衡人性化判断。  
   - **绩效反馈**：  
     - 反馈需具体、及时且具建设性，避免泛泛而谈。  
     - 绩效评估应聚焦未来发展（如成长规划），而非仅回顾过去表现。

4. **关键挑战与策略**  
   - **员工不可预测性**：需动态调整管理策略，适应复杂人性与团队动态。  
   - **群体与技术互动**：通过优化团队协作模式与技术工具提升整体效能（如Tavistock研究所的“社会技术系统”理论）。

#### **实践启示**
1. **管理者的核心任务**：  
   - 将人力资源（个体能力）与社会资本（团队协作）转化为竞争优势。  
   - 需结合经典理论与现代工具（如数据分析、灵活激励）应对管理复杂性。

2. **文化塑造**：  
   - 通过榜样示范（如领导者行为）、群体规范（如团队价值观）强化组织凝聚力。

3. **长期视角**：  
   - 重视员工发展（如培训、反馈机制），而非仅关注短期绩效目标。

**总结**：本模块强调管理者需综合运用心理学、行为经济学与组织理论，设计科学的激励与评估系统，并通过技术工具与人性化管理平衡，实现员工潜能的最大化释放。

## 模块标题：Week 1: Motivation and Reward

引言：In this module, you'll learn how motivation affects an individual's performance and how to use that motivation to drive performance. You'll explore how incentive systems are designed and how psychological concepts such as behavior modification, imitation, conformity, and compliance influence and shape these systems. You’ll also examine the current process of hiring employees using technology, tracking systems, and outsourcing. And you’ll learn how you can provide valuable feedback to your employees, and make performance appraisals productive. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to apply what you've learned to best motivate, hire, and evaluate your employees.

### 第一章：Professor Introductions and Course Overview

#### 视频小节1：Professor Cappelli and Professor Useem Introductions

字幕文本：

Welcome to Managing Human and Social Capital, part of the course Management Leadership. I'm Mike Useem. I'm on the faculty Professor of Management here at the Wharton School. I'm going to be working with my friend and colleague Peter Capelli also a Professor of Management here at the Wharton school. >> I also direct our Center for Human Resources and Mike directs the Center for Leadership and Change here at the Wharton School. So we've both been here forever, I think, pretty much. >> Yeah, pretty much. >> For a very long time. And we've been teaching this course, I've been teaching it for about 30 years or so. And I think it's maybe important to hear a little bit about the kind of work that we have done. Mike and I together have written a couple of books. We're finishing one now about China and how the private companies in China manage, particularly the CEO's there. We wrote at one a little earlier about India the same thing. And based on interviews with the leaders of those companies in both countries.

>> And Peter just maybe to add to that, we've also spent a lot of time inside companies trying to appreciate how they get people to come to work in the morning and do a great job. And that I think is going to describe, all these pieces are going to describe how we're going to take this on. We're going to bring in research, some of which we've done, we're going to bring in examples, some of which we've seen. All this designed to pull people's thinking forward on if they've got more than a couple people working for them, how to ensure that those people show up a 9 o'clock in the morning, do a great job, leave at the end of the day? 
>> We weren't here at the beginning of the Wharton School. It's been around for a very long time. This is the world's oldest business school. But the topic of managing people has been central to the history of the school. World War I, so about a hundred years ago, one of the most important developments in the 20th century was the rise of scientific management, Taylorism as some people call it. Frederick Taylor was teaching here at the Wharton School and his great patron was Joseph Wharton, who was the CEO of Bethlehem Steel at the time. And after that, Elton Mayo began his career here. He was the guy who founded the Human Relations School, which basically discovered the idea that people are not rational completely

Incentive-driven machines. And that the dynamics within groups matter an awful lot as well. And in 1980s, the Tavistock Institute was here, moved here from London. It's a famous place that figured out that if you thought carefully about how groups interacted, people interacted with groups and technology, you could get much more effective management and organization performance. There's a long history of this here. A lot of it begins before we got here. >> And Peter, maybe to take, pick up on that and get us into the course itself, we gotta know where we're going, and that's having a strategy, and a way to execute around that, and that's part of this course. But, having referenced Frederick Taylor and others along the way, we've come to appreciate over quite a number of years now that because people are sometimes unpredictable, their personalities that we carry around will a little bit complex. That we cannot take it for granted the people once hired, we'll get the job done and a way their that we want them to or that will give their all to it. And with that, a lot of thinking has followed into your sense of Patrick Taylor did his great work. We have the for example the work of Stanley McChrystal, the US commanding officer in Afghanistan has written a great book called Team of Teams. And his focus there is once we got people in groups, then how do we actually knit those teams together? Or think Cheryl Sandberg who wrote this book as the number two person at Facebook, called Lean In, which is about how you exercise influence in the workplace, individually and more than that. And so we're going to draw on the work of Stanley McChrystal, Cheryl Sandberg, Frederick Taylor and others, on this critical area which is how Human and social capital can be put to great advantage.
