调整分录

#### **关键结论提炼**  
1. **调整分录的核心目的**  
   • **连接交易与报表**：将日常交易按权责发生制转化为财务报表数据，确保收入与费用正确匹配。  
   • **四大调整类型**：  
     | **调整类别**       | **定义与案例**                                                                 | **会计分录逻辑**                                      |  
     |---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
     | **递延费用**         | 预付费用（如租金、保险费）随使用逐步费用化                                        | 借：费用；贷：预付资产（如预付租金）。                   |  
     | **递延收入**         | 预收账款（如会员费）随服务提供逐步确认收入                                        | 借：未实现收入（负债）；贷：收入。                      |  
     | **应计费用**         | 已发生但未支付的费用（如应付工资、利息）                                          | 借：费用；贷：应付负债（如应付工资）。                   |  
     | **应计收入**         | 已赚取但未收现的收入（如应收利息）                                              | 借：应收资产（如应收利息）；贷：收入。                   |  

2. **折旧与摊销的会计处理**  
   • **核心逻辑**：将长期资产成本分摊至其使用寿命内，匹配相关收入。  
   • **折旧（有形资产）**：  
     ◦ **直线法公式**：  
       \[
       \text{年折旧额} = \frac{\text{资产原值} - \text{残值}}{\text{使用寿命}}
       \]  
     ◦ **累计折旧账户**：作为“固定资产”的抵减项（贷方余额），反映资产累计损耗。  
   • **摊销（无形资产）**：  
     ◦ 通常直接减少无形资产账户，部分公司使用“累计摊销”抵减账户。  
   • **管理层判断影响**：使用寿命与残值估计影响折旧费用（如航空公司飞机折旧假设差异）。  

---

#### **核心会计原则应用**  
1. **权责发生制的实质**  
   • **收入确认**：服务完成即确认收入（无论现金是否到账），如应收利息的应计收入调整。  
   • **费用匹配**：成本与受益期对应，如预付租金按月摊销。  

2. **调整分录的实践意义**  
   • **避免利润扭曲**：  
     ◦ **例**：若忽略应付工资调整，费用低估导致净利润虚增。  
   • **财务报表完整性**：调整分录确保资产负债表与利润表反映真实财务状况。  

---

#### **实践警示与深度洞见**  
1. **常见误区与核查要点**  
   • **调整分录不涉及现金**：仅调整账户余额（如应付工资调整不涉及现金流出）。  
   • **折旧方法选择的影响**：  
     ◦ **直线法**：平滑利润，管理层偏好（如财务报表使用）。  
     ◦ **加速折旧法**：早期高费用，税务优化（如税法允许加速折旧抵税）。  

2. **管理层判断的财务影响**  
   • **折旧假设差异**：同一资产在不同公司可能因使用寿命假设不同导致折旧费用差异（如国际航空 vs 国内航空）。  
   • **透明度要求**：需在附注披露折旧政策与假设，供投资者分析可比性。

模块标题：Accural Accounting and the Income Statement

引言：We will start with a discussion of Accrual Accounting and how it affects the recognition of the Income Statement accounts: Revenues and Expenses. Then, we will cover adjusting entries, which are needed to prepare our internal books for the upcoming financial statements. Finally, we will discuss closing entries and the preparation of the Balance Sheet and Income Statement. At each stage, we will continue to work on the case of our start-up company. If you are not sick and tired of journal entries by the end of this week, then I have not done my job!

视频小节标题：Adjusting Entries I

字幕文本：

Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee, welcome back. In the next two videos, we're going to talk about adjusting entries. These entries help to get the books in shape, so that we can prepare financial statements. In this video, we'll talk about adjusting entries conceptually, and go through some examples. And in the next video, get some practice to do these journal entries. Let's get started.

So far we've looked at the part of the accounting cycle where a company is analyzing transactions, doing journal entries and posting the T accounts during the fiscal period. And at the end of the period, the company does an unadjusted trial balance to make sure that there are no mistakes made so far. Now we're going to move on and take a look at the next step in the cycle, which is adjusting entries.

Adjusting entries are internal transactions that update account balances in accordance with accrual accounting, prior to the preparation of financial statements. By internal transactions we mean that we're not doing anymore transactions with outsiders. This is just the accountant sitting at his or her desk doing journal entries to get accounts up to date to do financial statements. I guess the way to think about this is, if a company's fiscal period ends December 31st. Everyone else in the company's going to leave at 5 o'clock to go out for New Year's Eve parties. But the poor accountant has to stay behind, and do these adjusting entries before the company can get ready to do its financial statements for the end of the year.

There's two big categories to these entries. The first are called deferred revenues and expenses. In this case, we're updating some existing account balance to reflect its current accounting value. This happens when there's been some kind of cash flow in the past, but we need to record revenues or expenses now. The other big category are accrued revenues and expenses. Here we have to create some new account balances to record some previously unrecorded assets or liabilities. This will be situations where we're going to record a revenue or expense now, and there will be some kind of cash flow in the future. So don't worry, I'm going to go through examples of each of these types of adjusting entries, so you can see exactly what we mean by them.

>> Do any of these adjusting entries involve recording cash now?
>> No, adjusting entries never involve cash, because these are purely internal transactions. We're not doing any transactions with anyone outside the business at this point. So there's no more cash coming in and there's no more cash going out.

The first category we're going to look at are deferred expenses. So, as our poor accountant sits at his desk on New Year's Eve night, and watches his colleagues from sales and marketing and operations and human resources happily leave the company to go celebrate New Year's Eve. The accountant asks himself, are there any assets that have been used up this period and should be expensed?

The accounts that we'll see here are generally called prepaid accounts, like prepaid rent or prepaid insurance. Depreciation and amortization are also examples of a deferred expense, but we'll talk more about those later in the video, but let's think of something like prepaid rent. We paid cash in advance of occupying the space, so we create an asset called prepaid rent, but then, as time goes by and we've occupied the space we have to recognize the cost of the rent for the time that we've occupied the space. So we're going to do an adjusting journal entry where we debit an expense to recognize the cost of the rent that's been used up over time, and we're going to credit the prepaid asset to reduce the balance to how much that's still prepaid, if any, at the end of the year.

Next we have deferred revenues. So, as our accountants start to receive all sorts of text messages from his friends saying, hey, when you going to come out to the new year's eve party it's getting late. The accountant has to put away his phone, and think to himself, are there any liabilities that have been fulfilled by delivery of goods or services that should be recognized as revenue?

So, the accounts involved here would be things like unearned revenues or deferred revenues. So what's happened in this case is, we've received cash prior to providing goods or service. Now that time has gone by and we've earned the revenue. The adjusting journal entry will say credit revenue, to recognize the revenue that we've earned over time, and debit the unearned revenue liability to reduce the obligation because we fulfilled part of the obligation by delivering the goods or services over the time period.

>> Why would this be an adjusting entry? Wouldn't you know when you had delivered goods, and then just record this entry then?
>> Yeah, if we had delivered some goods we probably would have recognized revenue when we delivered the goods. But these examples are about providing some kind of service over time. And in this case, we just do an adjusting entry to recognize all the service provided over the period as opposed to doing an entry every month or week or day or hour or minute or second.

Next, we have accrued expenses. So, as our poor accountant decides to turn on the TV to watch something like New Year's Rocking Eve, so he can hear some of the music in the background that he's missing at all the parties. He, he has to ask himself, have any expenses accumulated during the period that have not yet been recorded? These accounts are all going to be payable type accounts.

What's going on here is that we've incurred some expense over time. But we haven't yet paid for in cash. So the adjusting journal entry we need to make is to debit an expense to recognize that expense, and credit a payable liability, to show that we have an obligation to pay for that expense. For example, if employees have worked for us but we haven't paid them yet. We have to debit a salaries and wages expense to recognize the cost of the employees working for us and then credit salaries and wages payable to show the liability that we have to pay our employees some point in the future.

Finally, we have accrued revenue. S,o as our poor accountant looks at the TV to watch the ball drop at Times Square he hurriedly asks himself, have any revenues accumulated during the period that have no yet been recorded? So he can do his one more set of adjusting journal entries.

The accounts we're talking about here are going to be receivable accounts like interest receivable or rent receivable.

An example would be, if we loaned someone else money, time has gone by so now they owe us interest. We would do a journal entry to credit revenue for the interest that they owe us.

And then we would debit a receivable asset, like interest receivable, to show that we have an asset for the amount of cash that we're going to collect in the future. So, this adjusting journal entry allows us to recognize revenue that we haven't recognized so far. And then show that we have an asset for the cash that we expect to collect in the future.

>> How can revenues be accumulated with you not knowing about it? When revenues are earned and realized, you should record the entry. Why is this an adjusting entry?
>> Again, these examples are about providing a service over time as opposed to delivering specific goods.

It says that it only matters that the revenue show up in the books when we put together financial statements. It's just easier to do the adjustment entry once at the end of the period, instead of doing it every month or week or hour, minute. You get the idea.

Finally, we're going to talk about depreciation and amortization. Which are just examples of differed expenses, but there is a lot more to them, so I want to give them their own couple of slides.

The goal of depreciation and amortization is to allocate the original cost of long-lived asset over its useful life. What we want to do is match the total cost of the asset to the revenues it generates over its period of years. If you remember back in the introductory video, we looked at Dave's car transport service. Dave had bought a truck that he intended to use for 48 months. Instead of recognizing the cost of that truck as an expense in the first month. We spread the cost out over 48 months through depreciation to try to match the cost of the truck to the revenue we think it will generate in the future. There's some terminology here, tangible assets, which are physical assets like buildings or equipment or a truck, we're going to call this process depreciation. For intangible assets, which are abstract assets like trademarks or customer lists which we've acquired in an acquisition, we're going to call this process amortization. But the process is going to be very similar, even though the terminology is different.

Now let's talk about the accounting procedure for depreciation and amortization.

Staring with depreciation, depreciation is not deducted from the tangible asset account. So, in other words, if you were taking depreciation on a truck, you wouldn't deduct it from the truck account. Instead, the depreciation's going to be recorded in a contra asset account called accumulated depreciation. A contra asset is denoted by XA in parentheses and it has a credit balance. Which means that contra assets go up with credits and down with debits. I think contra is a Latin word which means something like it has the balance on the opposite side where you'd expect the balance to be based in where it is on the balance sheet. [LAUGH] In other words, assets normally have debit balances, so they're increased with debits. A contra asset would have a credit balance. And be increased with a credit, because essentially, the contra asset is keeping track of reductions in a companion asset account.

Then what we'll see is when we put together the financial statements, the accumulated depreciation will be subtracted from property, plant, equipment on the balance sheet to get something called net book value.

Amortization is often deducted directly from the intangible account. So if you're amortizing a trademark, you would deduct it directly from the trademark account. However, nowadays there are companies that have fairly large intangible assets, and they've started to use accumulated amortization accounts as well. So that's just another type of contra asset where the accounting works just like accumulated depreciation. But I think the most common treatment you see is that the amortization just comes directly out of the intangible asset account.

>> Where do Contra Assets fit into the balance sheet equation? Why do they have a credit balance if they are assets? >> I admit that it's hard to get your head around the notion of a contra account. Let me pull up the super T account to show you where a contra assets sits on the balance sheet. So the contra asset is on the asset side of the balance sheet but it has a credit balance. That means an increase in a contra asset would reduce total assets. The way to think about it is a contra account is keeping track of the decreases, or reductions in a specific asset account. It's almost like an expense. Expenses sit on the shareholder's equity side of the balance sheet in retained earnings. But, they have a debit balance. That means an increase in expense reduces retained earnings. And, in fact, an expense is just a contra shareholder's equity account. So, you've actually seen this before. And you're going to see a lot of it again. And as you see it over and over I think it'll become more intuitive to you.

>> And why not just deduct depreciation from the regular asset account?
>> Excellent question. When we get to the video where we put together a balance sheet we'll see that the common format for reporting property, plant, equipment is to show the original cost or the property, plant, equipment separate from how much it's been depreciated over time. And in order to provide that format we have to keep track of this accumulated depreciation in a separate account.

To calculate the amount of depreciation expense every year almost every company uses a method called straight-line depreciation. Under this method, the depreciation expense is equal to the original cost of the asset minus it's salvage value, all divided by it's useful life. The salvage value is what you think the asset is going to be worth when you are done using it. So in the numerator we're taking how much of the assets is cost you're going to use up. And then the useful life is the number of periods you expect to use the asset.

So, under straight line depreciation, the amount of the depreciation expense is going to be the same for each year of the asset's life.

>> Are there other methods of depreciation? Why do almost all companies use straight-line for their financial statements? 

>> Yes, there are accelerated methods of depreciation where you recognize higher depreciation in the early years of an asset's life and then much less depreciation in later years of an asset's life. These methods are used for tax purposes, which we're going to talk about much later in the course. My conjecture is that most managers like to use straight line depreciation because it produces nice smooth earnings. If you use accelerated depreciation, then your earnings will be more volatile depending on whether you have a lot of new equipment, which is got high depreciation or a lot of equipment which is later in its life, which has much lower depreciation.

>> Who determines the useful life and the salvage value? Is it a central government agency?
>> No, for financial reporting purposes, there is no central government agency that dictates useful life and salvage value. Managers are supposed to choose the useful life based on how long they intend to use the asset and then the salvage value will be a function how long they intend to use it. So, to see how this works, let's talk about a couple airlines. There's a major international airline which has a strategy of only flying pretty new state of the art planes. They'll buy a brand new plane, fly it for five years, and then sell it to someone else. So, when they choose their depreciation assumptions, their useful life is five years, and they have a very high salvage value.

Now there's a major domestic airline that tends to fly their planes for 20, 30, 40 years. I'm not going to mention the name but you probably know who it is. Their strategy, if they bought a brand new plane, would be to choose a useful life of 20 years and then they would have a low salvage value as a result. So you get two airlines buy the same plane and have different depreciation assumptions, but that's okay because the depreciation assumptions are supposed to match how the manager intends to use the plane, not anything that has to do with the physical life of the plane.

So I think I've probably fully depreciated your energy at this point, so why don't we wrap up here? I'll see you next video where we'll do some more practice with adjusting journal entries. See you then.

>> See you next video.
