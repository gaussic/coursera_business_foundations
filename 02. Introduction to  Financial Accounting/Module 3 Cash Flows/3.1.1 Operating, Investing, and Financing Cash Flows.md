## Operating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flows

经营，投资，融资现金流

### **关键结论提炼**

#### **1. 现金流量表的三大分类**
- **经营活动**：  
  - **定义**：与日常运营相关的现金收支，如销售商品、支付供应商/员工费用、利息和税款。  
  - **特点**：类比利润表，反映核心业务产生现金的能力。  
  - **调整项**：需剔除非现金项目（如折旧、摊销）及非经营性损益（如出售资产损益）。

- **投资活动**：  
  - **定义**：涉及长期资产的买卖，包括购置/出售固定资产、无形资产、投资其他企业或证券（持有期>1年）。  
  - **例外**：短期投资（如计划持有6个月的股票）可能归类为经营活动。

- **融资活动**：  
  - **定义**：与所有者或债权人相关的交易（除利息外），如发行股票、偿还债务本金、回购股票、支付股息。  
  - **利息处理**：美国GAAP将利息归为经营活动，IFRS允许灵活分类（需保持一致性）。

---

#### **2. GAAP与IFRS的关键差异**
- **利息与股息**：  
  - **GAAP**：利息收支和股息收入均归为经营活动，股息支付归融资活动。  
  - **IFRS**：允许企业自主分类（需披露一致性）。  
- **影响**：跨国分析需注意分类差异，调整可比性（例如分析师常将利息从经营现金流中剔除）。

#### **3. 企业生命周期的现金流模式**
通过初创制药公司案例，展示不同阶段的现金流特征：
- **初创期**：  
  - 经营现金流（负）：研发投入高，收入有限。  
  - 投资现金流（大额负）：购置长期资产。  
  - 融资现金流（正）：依赖外部融资（股权/债权）。
  
- **成长期**：  
  - 经营现金流（转正）：产品成功带来收入。  
  - 投资现金流（持续负）：扩张产能或并购。  
  - 融资现金流（正）：仍需外部资金支持增长。

- **成熟期**：  
  - 经营现金流（高正）：核心业务盈利稳定。  
  - 投资现金流（负但减少）：维持性资本支出。  
  - 融资现金流（负）：偿还债务、回购股票或派息。

- **衰退期**：  
  - 经营现金流（下降）：市场竞争或专利到期。  
  - 投资现金流（低负或正）：减少新投资。  
  - 融资现金流（负）：继续向股东返还现金。

---

#### **4. 重要调整与非现金交易**
- **非现金项目调整**：如折旧、摊销、资产处置损益需从经营现金流中剔除，真实反映现金变动。  
- **非现金交易披露**：以物易物等交易需在报表底部单独披露。

---

#### **5. 现金流量表编制结构**
1. **经营活动现金流** → **投资活动现金流** → **融资活动现金流**  
2. **总和** = 现金净变动（需与资产负债表现金余额变化一致）。  
3. **强制披露**：支付的利息和税款（GAAP要求，便于分析师调整）。

---

### **实践应用启示**
- **分析重点**：经营现金流是否持续为正，能否覆盖投资需求（自由现金流=经营现金流-资本支出）。  
- **警惕信号**：长期依赖融资维持经营或投资，可能预示商业模式问题。  
- **生命周期判断**：通过现金流结构评估企业所处阶段及战略健康度。

---

**总结**：现金流量表揭示了企业“现金为王”的本质，通过分类分析可穿透会计利润表象，评估真实财务韧性及战略可持续性。理解准则差异与生命周期特征，是成为 savvy 分析师或管理者的关键一步。

模块标题：Week 3: Cash Flows

引言：Cash is King! We will start with the classification of cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities. Then, we will work on preparing and analyzing the Statement of Cash Flows. We will wrap up the case on the start-up company by preparing and analyzing its Statement of Cash Flows. Finally, we will discuss the differences between Earnings, Cash from Operations, EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow.

第一章：Operating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flows

视频小节1：Operating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flows

字幕文本：

Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee, welcome back. This week we're going to spend the entire week talking about the Statement of Cash Flows. And we're going to need the whole week to get through it. In this first video, we're going to talk about how to classify transactions into operating, investing, and financing activities. Which is the first step toward putting together and then analyzing the statement of cash flows. We've got a lot of work to do so lets get to it.

The statement of cash flows is going to report changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities over a period of time. So a period like a fiscal quarter or a fiscal year, any period between two balance sheet dates. Statement has the following format. Kicks off with net cash from operating activities, then cash from investing activities, and cash from financing activities. You add them all up and that should be the same as the net change in cash balance.

If the company does any non-cash transactions. Like the trade a piece of land for a building. Those have to be disclosed at the bottom of the statement of cash flows. Two other required disclosures. Companies must tell you cash interest paid and cash income taxes paid, for reasons that we'll talk about in later videos. But these disclosures either will appear at the bottom of the cash flow statement or somewhere else in the footnotes.

>> Cash is cash. It is what it is. Why divide it into three categories? You professors just have too much time on your hands. Do you always have to make everything so difficult?
>> Remember back to one of the first videos in the course. We looked at this example, Dave's Car Transport Service. In that example we saw why it's important not to look at total cash flow. Because all Dave had to do to increase his total cash flow is either borrow more money or raise more equity. What we really want to know is how much cash flow is being generated by operating the business? How much cash flow is the business investing in the future? And how is the business financing itself? That's why it's important to look at these three buckets and separate the cash flows in operating, investing, and financing.

Let's talk about each of these three buckets of activities in more detail starting with operating activities. These are transactions related to providing goods and services to customers and paying expenses related to generating revenue. The best way to think about this section is it's the analogy to the income statement. So transactions that appear on the income statement, we tend to see their cash impact in the cash from operating activities section. So we'll see cash inflows like collections from customers. But other sources of, of revenue or positive income like receiving interest or dividends on investment. And we'll see cash outflows like payments to suppliers, payments to employees, payments of interest and tax. Other operating disbursements like payments for advertising, legal fees, and other things like that.

>> I see the words interest and dividends on investments. Wouldn't that be an investing activity.
>> Yeah, a case could certainly be made that dividends received and interests received should be investing cash flows. Because their returns on your investment. But these items also appear on the income statement. And the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the FASB decided that they wanted them as part of the operating cash flow. To provide comparability between the income statement, and cash from operations. But I have the feeling we'll be talking about these items more as the video goes along.

There are a few types of transaction that appear on the income statement that we need to make special adjustments for on the cash flow statement. Because even though they're in the income statement they will not be part of cash from operating activities. The first type of adjustment is for depreciation, amortization, and other non cash items. These will affect income, but there's no cash flow involved. So we need to make an adjustment for them.

Also sometimes we get gains or losses on selling something like property planned equipment, which affect our income statement. But we don't want to show the cash flow in the operating activities section, we want to show it in investing activities section. So we need to adjust for that. We're going to make these adjustments later on in the week, but I just wanted to put them in the back of your mind right now.

The next bucket is investing activities. These are transactions related to acquiring or disposing long term assets. So cash inflow is like selling property plant equipment, selling a tangible asset, selling investments, or selling a whole business. A business divestiture. Cash outflow examples would be acquiring a business, acquiring property plant equipment, acquiring intangible assets, or purchasing investments.

>> What if buy stock as an investment, but I only intend to hold it for six months? Would that be a long-term asset? Would that be an investing activity?
>> You bring up an excellent point. There's a rule of thumb that any asset that we intend to hold for more than a year would be an investing activity. Whereas any asset we intend to hold for less than a year would be an operating activity. But this is a rule of thumb, it's not an iron clad law, and there are going to be places where we see that this rule of thumb is violated. In the case of investments, there's a whole set of rules around whether the investment should be operating or investing activities. And we'll talk about those later in the course.

In the last bucket is financing activities. These are transactions related to owners or creditors. Except for interest payments.

>> Except for interest payments. If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas. Interest is paid to creditors. Payments to creditors are financing activities. Ergo, interest payments are financing activities. QED.
>> It's hard to argue with a QED. But this is a situation where the FASB wanted comparability between the income statement and cash from operations. And so they decided to include interest payments as an operating activity to parallel the interest expense that's in net income. Having said that, a lot of investor analyst disagree with this classification and want to pull it out. If you remember earlier in the video I mentioned companies have to report cash paid for interest somewhere in their financial statements. That disclosures there so if people don't want cash paid for interest in operating cash flows. They can just find this disclosure and take it out.

So what financing activities will include are cash inflows such as the money you get from issuing new stock or reissuing treasury stock. That's when you take the stock that you previously bought back, called treasury stock, and then sell it back to the public. Or money you get from borrowings from banks or other creditors. Cash out flows include paying dividends to your shareholders, purchasing your treasury stocks or repurchasing your own stock. And then payment of principal on debt. But as we mentioned earlier not the payment of interest.

So putting it all together, the statement of cash flows is going to have these operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Listed in this order showing you the three different buckets where a companies cash flow comes from or goes to during a period.

>> I believe your classification of interest in dividends is not correct. After you crashed my question earlier I texted my sister who works in Hong Kong. She confirmed that interest and dividends received are investing activities. What do you have to say about that?
>> Well, I'm certainly not going to argue with your sister from Hong Kong, especially since we're both right on this one. As it turns out, this is one of those situations where the treatment under U.S. GAAP is different. Than the treatment under international financial reporting standards, or IFRS. I've been giving you the U.S. GAAP treatment. But the IFRS treatment does differ.

Let me jump back to the slide to show you these IFRS differences. We're talking about transactions where a company receives interest and dividends on investments, or pays interest, or pays dividends. Under IFRS, interest and dividends received and paid can be classified as operating, investing, or financing. As long as the company's consistent. The idea is as long as the company does the same thing year after year, investors and analysts will know where to find it. And can make adjustments if they think it's necessary. But under U.S. GAAP, these four items all have to be in the buckets that we show on the slide. There's no discretion. So that's one of the differences that remain between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

Now that we've defined operating, investing, and financing activities. I'd like to do a simple example to show you what we can learn by dividing cash flow into these three buckets. So let's say we're a start up company. We're a pharmaceutical, and we're trying to come up with a medicine that will prevent grey hair.

Not that there's anything wrong with gray hair.

So anyway, all you have to do is pop a pill and you'd no longer have gray hair.

As a startup company, we're likely going to have negative cash from operations. We may have an initial version of our drug that's working, for which we get some revenue. But we have a lot of negative cash flows as we have a lot of operating costs running the business and we're also investing in R and D.

Our investing cash flow is a big negative. Because we have to go out and create facilities and buy equipment and invest in all these long term assets to get the business up and running. And then we have a big positive financing cash flow. We go out and raise money from the stock market. Or venture capital firms we borrowed money from banks or the public market. We need all that money coming in. To finance our investments and the negative cash of operations. The bottom line in this case is 0 net cash flow. That, that doesn't necessarily need to be the case. But I will just carry that throughout.

Now our company starts to have some breakthroughs. We move into the early growth stage. Drug seems to be working pretty well. People are taking the medication. Their grey hair goes away. And we're starting to get positive operating cash flows. As more and more doctors prescribe our medicine. We get revenue that comes in and covers the operating costs. We still have big negative investing cash flow because we're trying to grow the business. And we're trying to invest in new property plant equipment to meet demands for our drug. And maybe we decide to go and acquire another company to diversify our product line. So maybe we acquire a company that makes pro-blonde medication. So you can take the pill and your hair will turn blonde even if it was say dark brunette to begin with. Not, not that there's anything wrong with dark brunette hair either.

So anyway we have the big negative investing cash flow. We cannot fund that investing cash flow just out of operations. So we have a positive Financing Cash Flow. As the, we need to go out and raise money either from the stock market or from banks and other creditors.

>> Hey, this is actually useful information. Can we get more of this?
>> Hey, I'm glad you liked it. I've got two more examples. So, let's get back to it.

Next, our company moves in to the mature phase of it's life cycle. We've got patents on our anti-gray hair drug, our pro-blond hair drug. And we can just print money as a result. There's a lot of revenue coming in, covering all the expenses of running the business, so we have a high cash from operations. We still have a fairly high level of investing cash outflows. Because we're still growing, we have capital expenditures that we need to have to meet the demand for our product. Maybe we're doing a couple of other strategic acquisitions.

But now we're able to pay back some of the financing, so we have negative financing cash flows. We use the excess cash operating after covering the investing cash flow. To go out and buy back stock, or pay back debt, or maybe start to pay dividends to our shareholders.

Then we move into the decline stage of our life cycle. All of our patents have expired, customers can now buy generic anti-grey hair medication, or generic pro blonde medication. There's a few hold outs that still insist on buying our original name brand. But our cash from operations have gone down substantially.

Our investing cash flows have also gone down substantially, because we just don't have a lot of other ideas for new investments. And so we end up doing is continue to have a negative financing cash outflow. We're taking our excess cash from operations and using it to buy back stock, repay debt, or pay dividends. Which at this point is essentially just saying to our shareholders. We don't have any projects to invest in, so we're just going to give you the money, and maybe you can find something to do with it. Because we certainly can't.

And then, I guess, the last stage would be, we either go bankrupt or acquired. And our cash flow statement would disappear altogether.

So I think this video showed that it's fairly straightforward to classify cash flow activities into the operating, investing, and financing buckets. But it's not always straightforward. In the next video, we're going to apply these classifications to the Relic Spotter case. And there we'll see that there is judgement that does apply in some situations which makes this a bit trickier than it first seems. I'll see you next video. 

>> See you next video.
