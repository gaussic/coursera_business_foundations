### Week 4: Ratio Analysis 总结（3M公司案例）

#### **关键分析工具与方法**
1. **数据来源与可靠性**  
   - **推荐工具**：使用 **Morningstar** 等权威平台获取长期、一致的财务比率（需关注定义是否与标准一致）。  
   - **注意事项**：避免随意使用互联网数据，需确保比率计算方式透明（如Morningstar提供术语表）。  

2. **杜邦分析（DuPont Analysis）**  
   - **ROE分解**：  
     \[
     \text{ROE} = \text{财务杠杆} \times \text{ROA} = \text{财务杠杆} \times (\text{销售利润率} \times \text{资产周转率})
     \]
   - **3M的ROE趋势**：  
     - **2018-2021年小幅下降**（约27%→24%），主要因财务杠杆降低（负债减少）。  
     - **ROA波动**：受销售利润率（净利率）和资产周转率共同影响（无显著趋势）。  

3. **利润率分析**  
   - **毛利率**：接近**50%**，反映强大定价权或成本控制能力。  
   - **SG&A费用率**：稳定（约**22-24%**），未随规模增长下降，未实现规模经济。  
   - **研发投入占比**：未明确数据，但作为技术驱动型公司，需关注其对长期利润率的影响。  

4. **流动性指标**  
   - **流动比率**：>2（健康水平）。  
   - **速动比率**：>1.3（现金与应收账款覆盖短期债务能力强）。  

5. **效率比率**  
   - **应收账款天数（DSO）**：轻微下降趋势，收款效率提升。  
   - **存货天数**：75-85天（稳定，制造业合理水平）。  
   - **净营业周期（Cash Conversion Cycle）**：结合DSO、存货与应付账款天数，反映短期融资需求。  

---

#### **核心结论**
1. **财务健康状况**：  
   - **低杠杆风险**：债务权益比（Debt to Equity）<1，长期债务/有形资产比低，融资空间充足。  
   - **短期偿付无忧**：流动比率与速动比率均优于行业标准。  

2. **盈利能力与挑战**：  
   - **高毛利护城河**：50%毛利率体现技术壁垒或品牌溢价。  
   - **ROE下降隐忧**：虽仍处高位（24%），但需警惕杠杆收缩对股东回报的持续影响。  

3. **运营效率**：  
   - **应收账款管理优化**：DSO缩短反映客户信用政策收紧或收款流程改进。  
   - **存货稳定**：无显著积压或短缺风险。  

4. **行业对比**：  
   - **研发驱动型公司特征**：高毛利率、稳定SG&A费用率与ROE，与竞争对手（如杜邦、霍尼韦尔）模式类似。  

---

#### **潜在风险与关注点**
1. **ROE持续性**：  
   - 若未来无法通过技术创新维持高毛利，ROE可能进一步下滑。  
2. **研发投入效益**：  
   - 需验证高研发费用是否转化为新产品收入（未直接披露）。  
3. **行业竞争压力**：  
   - 技术迭代可能削弱现有产品优势（如替代材料或数字化解决方案）。  

---

#### **分析师提问方向**
1. **研发转化效率**：  
   - 近年研发投入占收入比例是多少？主要聚焦哪些领域？  
2. **毛利率维持策略**：  
   - 高毛利是否依赖特定专利产品？专利到期风险如何应对？  
3. **杠杆策略调整**：  
   - 为何主动降低财务杠杆？是否影响未来扩张计划？  

---

#### **总结**  
3M凭借**技术壁垒**与**高效运营**保持高盈利与低风险，但需关注研发转化效率与行业竞争对ROE的潜在冲击。比率分析揭示了其财务稳健性，但需结合管理层解释与行业动态进一步验证。

模块标题：Week 4: Ratio Analysis

引言：We will have our final exam this week. Because of the exam, I will cover Ratio Analysis, which will not involve any "new" material. While we will define and discuss a number of ratios, they will all basically involve dividing one accounting number by another. But, the analysis of what those ratios mean will involve a deep understanding of Balance Sheet and Income Statement accounts. Thus, the Ratio Analysis videos will help provide a nice review of the material, which will help you prepare for the exam. However, there will be no questions about ratio analysis on the exam. The only thing left to do after this exam is to impress your family, friends, and co-workers with your vast knowledge of Financial Accounting!

第三章：3M Company: Ratios

视频小节1：3M Company: Ratios

字幕文本：

Hello, I'm professor Brian Buchet, welcome back. In this video, we're going to do a ratio analysis on the 3M Company, the company who's financial statements we've been following along with this entire course. Let's get started.

So, here we are at 3M's financial statements. So, there's a couple of ways we could do the ratios. We could take all the numbers in the income statements, and in the balance sheet that we need and also from the cash flow statement, put them in a spreadsheet or put them in our calculator and calculate the ratios.

A second way we could do it is try to look the ratios up on the internet. Why don't we do the second?

Before we jump on the Internet to pull some ratios, a quick warning. There's a lot of bad stuff on the Internet. Hopefully you aren't thinking that this course is one of those bad things, but the problem with ratios provided on the Internet is, oftentimes the provider does not give you the definitions. You don't know how they're calculating the ratios. So my advice is find one source that you trust, so they seem to use the same ratios that you would get doing it by hand and then always use that source so at least the ratios will always have consistent definitions.

So one of the best sources on the web that I found to get ratios is Morningstar, because they give you a long time series of ratios that you can use. So if we look at 3M Company's page there's some summary financial information and then key ratios. So we've got right here return on equity, so that's our starting point in the new pond formula. You notice it's sort of been going down the last few years slightly. We can look at the components, here's financial leverage going down, so they're becoming less leveraged over time. Return on assets, up and then down again, so a little bit more volatility with return on assets.

Then you can look at return on assets going into asset turnover, and what they call net margin percent, it's what I call return on sales. It's the profitability. And you can see the profitability up and then sort of down again. Which is tracking what we saw with ROA. And asset turnover has been up and down as well. But what we really need is to find three or four of 3M's closest competitors, and then compare these ratios to the competitors, to see whether these trends are specific to 3M or whether there's some kind of industry of fact that's going on. But, based on my knowledge of the industry, these are still pretty healthy ROE and ROA numbers. And then above, we have the profit margin breakdown, so we have gross margin, which is really high, almost 50%, SGNA to sales, which has been fairly flat, and operating margin. You also get R and D in a sales sense it is a company that does R and D, and so we get to see the profitability margin ratios as well. In case you're wondering, the TTM column on the far right, that stands for trailing 12 months, so that's the last 12 months before the date of the ratio calculation.

Then there's the tab for some growth percentages. So this is just year and year three year average, five year average, ten year average. Growth in revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share.

Similar numbers for growth in cash flow.

Financial health, this is essentially the common size balance sheet for 3M.

And then down below we have our old friends the quick and current ratio. 3M is in really good shape, current ratio above two, quick ratio above 1.3, 1.4. Financial leverage, which we saw earlier, and then a more traditional debt to equity ratio. Looks like 3M is not a very risky company, not very highly levered. Then there's efficiency ratios so here we have day sales outstanding, days inventory and days payable. So we can see there's a slight downward trend in 3M's days sales outstanding.

Their inventory turnover's been sorta steady between 75, 85 days and their payables ratio's similar. What they call cash conversion cycle is what I was calling the net trade cycle. So it's basically the number of days you'd have to borrow from a bank. And then if you want to look at the ratios the other way, they have receivables, turnover, inventory turnover, fixed asset turnover and asset turnover.

And then one more thing to show you is Morningstar has an extensive glossary, so if you don't know what any of these terms are, like one ratio we didn't talk about is Return on Invested Capital, that's net income divided by stockholders' equity plus long-term debt and capital leases, short-term debt, capital leases. So basically, it's like ROE except it also adds debt into the denominator.

So, you could just pull the ratios from a source like this, pull them from three or four competitors and then do the comparisons, you don't have to use your own calculator or spreadsheet to calculate all these ratios. And that's a wrap on our week long look at ratio analysis. Now it's time for you to focus on the exam. Good luck and I'll see you on the other side.
