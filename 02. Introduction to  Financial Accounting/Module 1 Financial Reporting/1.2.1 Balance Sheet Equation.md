#### 课程整体介绍

由布莱恩・布歇教授讲授，旨在介绍会计语言中的资产负债表等式，阐述其如何让财务报表相互契合，并运用该等式解决存在信息缺失的问题，期望学生借此熟悉课程常见题型。

#### 资产负债表等式基础内容

- 核心规则：资产负债表等式（会计恒等式）是会计唯一语法规则，即资产等于负债加股东权益，也可理解为公司资源等同于外部及所有者的权益主张。
- 现实应用示例：以购买价值 50 万美元房子为例，用手头 5 万美元现金加 45 万美元抵押贷款购得，对应 50 万资产、45 万负债与 5 万权益，展现其在生活中的体现。

#### 等式相关特性及报表关联

- 平衡特性与复式记账法：等式需始终保持平衡，所以有复式记账法，对等式一侧操作时另一侧需相应增减项目维持平衡，且两张资产负债表间变化会在利润表、股东权益变动表、现金流量表中汇总体现。
- 不同情况示例：如房子价值变动（从 50 万涨至 100 万）及金融危机中银行抵押支持证券资产变化案例，说明对各报表影响，像房子增值不影响现金流量表却影响利润表权益；银行资产减值不改变负债但使权益下降致利润表显示亏损等情况。

#### 股东权益构成及完整等式呈现

- 股东权益构成部分：股东权益包含投入资本和留存收益，留存收益由期初留存收益、当期净利润、支付股息决定（留存收益 = 期初留存收益 + 净利润 - 股息），净利润又等于收入减费用。
- 完整等式推导：综合各要素可得完整资产负债表等式为资产 = 负债 + 投入资本 + 期初留存收益 + 收入 - 费用 - 股息。

#### 运用等式的解题练习

- 题目列举与解答思路：教授给出多道题目，如已知资产、负债求股东权益；负债变化、股东权益不变时求资产变化；给定非现金资产、负债、股东权益求现金；还有涉及现金、非现金资产、费用等变化时求对应项目变化情况等，分别按等式逻辑分析解答。
- 特殊情况说明：部分题目因股东权益情况不明等原因，严格来讲无法准确求解，需特定条件下才可算出结果。

#### 课程结尾

回顾课程围绕资产负债表等式展开的多方面讲解，告知下次课程将更详细地探讨资产、负债、股东权益相关内容后结束视频。

### 原文及翻译

Hello, I'm Professor Brian Bushee, and welcome back. In this video, we'll take a look at the one rule of grammar in the accounting language, the balance sheet equation. We'll see how the balance sheet equation makes all the financial statements fit together. We'll also use the balance sheet equation to solve some problems where we're missing one piece of information, but we can fill in everything that we do know into the balance sheet equation and solve for what we need. Hope you enjoy the video. 
大家好，我是布莱恩・布歇教授，欢迎回来。在本视频中，我们将了解一下会计语言中的一条语法规则，即资产负债表等式。我们会看到资产负债表等式是如何使所有财务报表相互契合的。我们还会运用资产负债表等式来解决一些问题，在这些问题中，我们会缺失某一项信息，但我们可以把已知的所有信息代入资产负债表等式，进而推算出我们所需要的信息。希望你们喜欢这个视频。

So if you've ever tried to learn a foreign language, you know that one of the most difficult things is learning all the rules of grammar, all the cases and declensions and the changes in verb endings and all that stuff. Well, the good news about learning the language of accounting is that there's only one rule of grammar, the balance sheet equation or the accounting identity. This is that assets equal liabilities plus stockholder's equity at all points in time. Another way to say this, as we've talked about, is that the resources of the company, equal the claims on those resources by the outsiders, and by the owners. 
如果你曾经尝试学习一门外语，就会知道最困难的事情之一就是学习所有的语法规则，包括各种格、词性变化、动词词尾变化等等诸如此类的内容。不过，学习会计这门语言有个好消息，那就是它只有一条语法规则，即资产负债表等式，或者叫会计恒等式。其内容是在任何时间点，资产都等于负债加上股东权益。正如我们之前所讲的，换一种说法就是，公司的资源等同于外部人员以及公司所有者对这些资源的权益主张。

>> Can you give me an example of when this is used in the real world? 
你能给我一个这个（资产负债表等式）在现实世界中应用的例子吗？

>> A good example to think about how we use the balance sheet equation in real life, is when we buy something big like a house, or a car. So, let's us say we wanted to buy a $500,000 house but we only had $50,000 of cash while we would need to go out and borrow $450,000 from the bank in a mortgage in order to buy the house. Then after we bought it we'd have 500,000 in assets, the house, which is equal to the 450,000 of liabilities, the mortgage. Plus 50,000 in equity, which is how much cash we put in and which represents our claim on that house. 
思考一下我们在现实生活中如何运用资产负债表等式，一个很好的例子就是当我们购买像房子或汽车这类大件物品的时候。比如说，我们想买一栋价值 500,000 美元的房子，但我们手头只有 50,000 美元现金，那么我们就需要出去从银行申请一笔 450,000 美元的抵押贷款来购买这栋房子。在我们买下房子之后，我们就拥有了价值 500,000 美元的资产（也就是这栋房子），它等于 450,000 美元的负债（也就是抵押贷款）加上 50,000 美元的权益（这就是我们投入的现金数额，它代表着我们对这栋房子的权益主张）。

The most important feature of the balance sheet equation is that it must always balance. And that's why we're going to talk about something they call double entry book keeping. If you increase something on one side of the equation, you have to increase or decrease something else to stay in balance. So, there has to be at least two entries any time you tinker with the balance sheet equation. And as we'll see, the changes between two Balance Sheets are going to be summarized in the Income Statement, the Statement of Stockholders' Equity, and the Statement of Cash Flows. So let me show you this graphically. So let's say we have a balance sheet at the end of December 31, 2014. Assets equal liabilities plus stockholders' equity. We'll split the assets into cash and non-cash assets, and we'll split stockholders' equity into contributed capital and retained earnings, which are concepts we'll talk more about in later videos. 
资产负债表等式最重要的特征在于它必须始终保持平衡。这就是为什么我们要来讲讲所谓的复式记账法。如果你在等式的一侧增加了某个项目，就必须在另一侧增加或减少其他项目以维持平衡。所以，每当你对资产负债表等式进行调整时，至少要有两笔分录。而且正如我们将会看到的那样，两张资产负债表之间的变化情况将会在利润表、股东权益变动表以及现金流量表中进行汇总。那我用图表的形式给你们展示一下吧。假设我们有一张截至 2014 年 12 月 31 日的资产负债表，资产等于负债加上股东权益。我们把资产划分为现金资产和非现金资产，把股东权益划分为投入资本和留存收益，这些都是我们在后续视频中会进一步详细讲解的概念。

Then we have a balance sheet at the end of the year, so we've got one at the beginning of 2015, at the end of 2015. The difference in the retained earnings is going to be explained in the income statement for the year end at December 31, 2015. And the difference in cash, is going to be explained in the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
然后我们有年末的资产负债表，所以我们有一张 2015 年初的和一张 2015 年末的。留存收益的差额将会在 2015 年 12 月 31 日的年度利润表中进行解释。现金的差额将会在 2015 年 12 月 31 日的年度现金流量表中进行解释。

>> Here you go again with the difference between income and cash. Remind me, why are they different? 
你又在讲收入和现金之间的差异了。提醒我一下，为什么它们会不一样呢？

>> Okay, let's go back to the house example. So, let's say on your first balance sheet at the beginning of the year you have a $500,000 house, which is your asset, $450,000 mortgage which is your liability, and $50,000 of equity. Now let's say that during the year the value of your house increases to a $1 million, now you can't actually do this in practice, but for the sake of the example, let's assume you could write up the value of the house from 500,000 to a million at the end of the year. So, your balance sheet at the end of the year would have a million dollar asset, the house, 450,000 of liabilities because the mortgage doesn't change, but your equity would go up from 50,000 to 550,000. Now, if you look at the statement that explains the changes in two balance sheets. None of this affects the cash flow statement because there's no cash impact of your house going up in value. In fact, your cash up should probably went down as you were paying the mortgage. But your income statement would show a gain of $500,000 from the increase in your equity due to your ownership claim of the house. 
好的，让我们再回到房子的例子上来。假设在年初的第一张资产负债表上，你有一栋价值 500,000 美元的房子，这是你的资产，有一笔 450,000 美元的抵押贷款，这是你的负债，还有 50,000 美元的权益。 现在假设在这一年里，你房子的价值涨到了 100 万美元，当然在实际操作中你并不能这样做，但为了便于举例，我们假设你可以在年末把房子的价值从 500,000 美元调高到 100 万美元。 那么，你年末的资产负债表上就会有一项价值 100 万美元的资产（也就是房子），负债依然是 450,000 美元（因为抵押贷款金额没有变化），但你的权益会从 50,000 美元增加到 550,000 美元。 现在，如果你查看用于解释两张资产负债表变化情况的报表，你会发现这一切都不会影响现金流量表，因为房子价值的上涨并没有产生现金方面的影响。实际上，随着你偿还抵押贷款，你的现金很可能还减少了。不过，你的利润表会显示因你对房子的所有权权益主张而使权益增加了 500,000 美元，也就是会显示一笔 500,000 美元的收益。

>> Housing prices going up? Can you give us a more contemporary example? 
房价上涨？你能给我们举一个更贴合当下情况的例子吗？

>> Okay, so let's talk about what happened during the financial crisis of 2007, 2008 and 2009. There were banks out there that had assets called mortgaged-backed securities. These are assets because they're claims on collecting cash payments from people that took out sub-prime mortgages. So let's say a bank had 10 billion of these mortgage-backed securities as assets. And let's say they had 9.5 billion of liabilities. And half a billion of equity. Financial crisis hits, these home owners no longer make their mortgage payments. Which means, these assets drop in value. So now they have to be written down in value from 10 billion to, let's say 1 billion. Now the liabilities don't change. In fact, that's why you need a government bailout because you're liabilities don't change. But what does change is the equity. The equity drops by 9 billion as well. And so it's another example where there's no cash flow impact of the change in these two balance sheets, but we end up showing a $9 billion loss on our income statement due to the drop in our equity claims on those assets. 
好的，那我们来谈谈 2007 年、2008 年和 2009 年金融危机期间发生的情况。当时有些银行持有被称作抵押支持证券的资产。它们之所以是资产，是因为其代表着对那些申请了次级抵押贷款的人收取现金还款的权益主张。 假设一家银行有 100 亿美元的这类抵押支持证券作为资产，并且假设其负债为 95 亿美元，权益为 5 亿美元。金融危机来袭，这些房屋所有者不再偿还抵押贷款了，这意味着这些资产的价值下降了。所以现在这些资产的价值必须从 100 亿美元减记至，比如说 10 亿美元。 现在负债并没有改变，实际上，这就是为什么需要政府出手救助的原因，因为负债没有变化。但发生变化的是权益，权益也下降了 90 亿美元。所以这又是一个例子，两张资产负债表的变化并没有对现金流量产生影响，但由于我们对这些资产的权益主张下降了，最终我们的利润表上会显示 90 亿美元的亏损。

Of course, we also have to mention the statement of stockholders' equity, which explains the changes in stockholders' equity between two balance sheets, which we will talk about more later in the course. What I want to do next is show you how everything that we're going to talk about fits into this balance sheet equation. 
当然，我们还必须提到股东权益变动表，它解释了两张资产负债表之间股东权益的变化情况，我们会在本课程后续内容中对此做更多讲解。接下来我想向你们展示的是，我们将要讨论的所有内容是如何与这个资产负债表等式相契合的。

So, we talked about how stockholders' equity is two components, contributed capital, which is the money that we raised from shareholders, and retained earnings, which is what we create by operating the business. Retained earning is going to equal whatever retained earnings were at the beginning of the period plus any net income, earned during the period minus any dividends paid out to shareholders. That's why it's called retained earnings, because it's the earnings or net income less any dividends paid out. 
那么，我们之前讲过股东权益由两部分构成，一是投入资本，也就是我们从股东那里筹集到的资金；二是留存收益，它是我们通过经营企业所创造出来的收益。留存收益将等于期初留存收益加上当期所赚取的任何净利润，再减去支付给股东的任何股息。这就是它被称作留存收益的原因，因为它是所赚取的收益（即净利润）减去已支付的股息之后剩余的部分。

And then net income, as we talked about in a prior video, is revenues minus expenses. So, if we put all of this into the balance sheet equation we get one big complete balance sheet equation, which is assets equal liabilities plus contributed capital, plus your prior retained earnings, plus revenues, minus expenses, minus dividends that you pay during the period. 
然后，正如我们在上一个视频中所讲的，净利润等于收入减去费用。所以，如果我们把所有这些内容都代入资产负债表等式中，就会得到一个完整的大型资产负债表等式，即资产等于负债加上投入资本，再加上期初留存收益，加上收入，减去费用，再减去当期支付的股息。

>> [FOREIGN] Are you going to make us do some mathematics with this? 
（用外语说）你打算让我们用这个（资产负债表等式）做些数学运算吗？

>> Why, yes. I am going to ask you to do some math. Now I'm going to give you some problems, give you a chance to try to answer the problems, and then we'll talk through the answers. After I read the problem, you'll see a little pause icon on the screen. If you want to try to answer the problem before I give you the answer, pause the video at this point, try to come up with the answer and then resume the video. But, if you want to just roll through and hear the answer right away, then it's okay to keep the video going. This is going to be the procedure that we follow any time that I give you some questions that I wanted to, want you to try to answer during the video lecture. 
当然啦。我确实打算让你们做些数学运算呢。现在我会给你们出一些题目，给你们机会试着解答这些题目，然后我们再一起讨论答案。在我读完题目后，你们会在屏幕上看到一个暂停图标。如果你们想在我给出答案之前试着解答题目，就在这时暂停视频，试着算出答案，然后再继续播放视频。不过，如果你们想直接往下看，马上听到答案，那也可以让视频继续播放。在视频授课过程中，只要我给出一些希望你们试着解答的问题，我们都会遵循这样的流程。

Okay, here is the first one. 
好的，这是第一道题。

Assets equal 100, liabilities equal 50. What is stockholders' equity? 
资产等于 100，负债等于 50。股东权益是多少？

We can solve this one with a balance sheet equation. We know that assets are 100. Liabilities are 50. The only thing that's missing is stockholder's equity, which has to be 50. So that we have 100 on the left hand side, and 100 on the right hand side. 
我们可以用资产负债表等式来解决这个问题。我们知道资产是 100，负债是 50。唯一缺失的就是股东权益，它肯定是 50，这样等式左边就是 100，右边也是 100。

Next, liabilities increase by 100 and stockholders' equity is unchanged. What is the change in assets? 
接下来，负债增加了 100，股东权益不变。资产的变化是多少？

Again, we can use the balance sheet equation to answer this, but now we're looking at changes in the numbers. So, stockholders' equity is unchanged, liabilities go up by 100, the only way for the equation to stay in balance is for assets to also go up by 100. Next, all non-cash assets are 70, total liabilities are 60, total stockholders' equity is 30. What is cash? 
同样，我们可以利用资产负债表等式来回答这个问题，不过现在我们关注的是数字的变化情况。所以，股东权益没有变化，负债增加了 100，要使等式保持平衡，唯一的办法就是资产也增加 100。 接下来，所有非现金资产是 70，总负债是 60，股东权益总计是 30。现金是多少？

We can use the Balance Sheet equation for this one if we separate assets into Cash and Noncash assets. So we have Liabilities of 60 and Stockerholders' Equity of 30, that's 90 on the right-hand side. Noncash assets are 70. The only thing missing is Cash, which has to equal 20, so that we have 90 on each side. 
如果我们把资产分为现金资产和非现金资产，就可以用资产负债表等式来解决这个问题。我们已知负债是 60，股东权益是 30，那么等式右边总计就是 90。非现金资产是 70。唯一缺失的就是现金，它必然等于 20，这样等式两边就都是 90 了。

Next, cash decreases by 10 and all non-cash assets increase by 15. What is the change in liabilities? 
接下来，现金减少了 10，并且所有非现金资产增加了 15。负债的变化是多少？

We can use the same equation but we have to be a little bit careful. We have cash going down by ten, noncash assets going up by 15, we're looking for liabilities, but we don't know what happened with stockholders' equity and because we don't know what happened with stockholders' equity, we actually don't have enough information to solve this. Now, if we knew that stockholders' equity had not changed, then liabilities would have had to go up by five, so that we have an increase in five on both sides of the equation. But without knowing what happened to stockholders' equity, we technically don't have enough information to answer this one. 
我们可以运用同样的等式来解题，但得稍微谨慎一些。我们知道现金减少了 10，非现金资产增加了 15，我们要求解负债的变化情况，但我们不知道股东权益发生了什么变化，由于不清楚股东权益的情况，实际上我们并没有足够的信息来解决这个问题。 现在，如果我们知道股东权益没有变化，那么负债就必须增加 5，这样等式两边就能各增加 5 以保持平衡。但在不知道股东权益变化情况的前提下，严格来说，我们并没有足够的信息来回答这个问题。

>> Oh, come on, a trick question, really? 
哦，拜托，这是个脑筋急转弯式的问题呀，真的吗？

>> Sorry about the trick question. But, I promise that it won't be the last.
很抱歉出了这么个脑筋急转弯式的问题。不过，我保证这不会是最后一个哦。

Next, we have Retained Earnings increasing by 100, dividends are 50. What is net income? 
接下来，我们已知留存收益增加了 100，股息是 50。净利润是多少？

Earlier in the video, we looked at the equation for retained earnings, where retained earnings is equal to prior retained earnings, what they were at the beginning of the year, plus net income during the period, minus dividends. So we know that the change in net income. Change in retained earnings, retained earnings minus prior retained earnings is 100. We know that dividends is 50, so the only thing missing is net income, which has to be 150 for this to balance. 
在视频前面的部分，我们看过留存收益的等式，留存收益等于期初留存收益（也就是年初时的留存收益数额），加上当期的净利润，再减去股息。所以我们知道留存收益的变动情况，留存收益减去期初留存收益等于 100。我们知道股息是 50，那么唯一缺失的就是净利润了，为了使等式平衡，净利润必须是 150 才行。

Next we have revenue increasing by 100, all other categories are unchanged except assets. What is the change in assets? 
接下来，收入增加了 100，除资产外的所有其他项目都没有变化。资产的变化是多少？

We have to use the complete balance sheet equation to solve this one, so that we break Stockler's equity into contributed capital, prior retained earnings, revenues, expenses and dividends. So, we know that revenues are going up by 100. Everything else is unchanged but assets, which means that assets also have to go up by 100 so that both sides of the equation increase by 100. Finally, expenses increase by 60 and all other categories are unchanged except cash. What's the change in cash? 
我们得用完整的资产负债表等式来解决这个问题，这样我们要把股东权益细分为投入资本、期初留存收益、收入、费用以及股息。那么，我们知道收入增加了 100。除资产外其他所有项目都没变化，这就意味着资产也必须增加 100，这样等式两边才能都增加 100。 最后，费用增加了 60，除现金外的所有其他项目都没有变化。现金的变化是多少呢？

We'll again use the complete balance sheet equation, but now we'll split assets into cash and non-cash assets. So we know that expenses went up by 60, everything else is unchanged except for cash. Now notice on the right-hand side of the equation, expenses going up by 60 means the right-hand side goes down by 60, which means the cash also has to go down by 60 for us to stay in balance. 
我们还是要用完整的资产负债表等式，不过现在我们要把资产分为现金资产和非现金资产。我们知道费用增加了 60，除现金外其他所有项目都没有变化。现在请注意，在等式右边，费用增加 60 意味着右边整体减少了 60，这就意味着为了保持等式平衡，现金也必须减少 60。

>> I think I can do this. Can we do more maths problems. 
我觉得我能做这个。我们可以再多做些数学题吗？

>> Finally some positive feedback. The purpose of this exercise was to preview the type of problem that you are going to be doing a lot in this course. There's going to be a certain piece of information that you need that you're not given. But, you can take all the other information that you're given, and a set of equations, that will usually be in the form of T accounts, or journal entries, fill in everything you know, and then solve for that one piece of information that you need, that you can't find in the financial statements.
终于得到了一些积极的反馈。这次练习的目的是让大家预先了解一下在本课程中你们将要大量接触的题型。会存在这样一种情况，有某条你们需要的信息并没有直接给到你们。但是，你们可以利用给到你们的所有其他信息，以及一组等式（通常会以 T 型账户或者日记账分录的形式呈现），把你们已知的所有内容都填进去，然后求解出那条你们需要却无法从财务报表中直接找到的信息。 

Wow, has it been twelve minutes already? Time sure flies when you're doing the balance sheet equation. So I'm going to go ahead and wrap up this video, and we'll come back next time and talk in more detail about assets, liabilities and shareholder's equity. I'll see you then! 
哇，已经过去 12 分钟了吗？做资产负债表等式相关的内容时，时间过得可真快呀。那我这就准备结束这个视频了，咱们下次再见，到时会更详细地聊聊资产、负债以及股东权益的相关内容。到时候见啦！

>> See you next video.
下次视频见。
