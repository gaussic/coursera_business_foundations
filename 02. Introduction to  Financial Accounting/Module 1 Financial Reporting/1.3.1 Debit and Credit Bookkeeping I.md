### 一、借方贷方的重要性及基本概念

1. **存在分歧但作用显著**：在会计学界对于是否教授借方和贷方存在分歧，教授本人认为借方和贷方是学习、教授会计知识的有用且强有力的工具，如今仍在使用，可帮助解决复杂交易及财务报表相关问题。
2. **簿记等式相关**：介绍了三个基本的簿记等式，分别是资产等于负债加上股东权益（资产负债表等式）、借方金额总和必须等于贷方金额总和、账户的期初余额加上增加额减去减少额必须等于账户的期末余额，这些等式任何时候都要保持平衡，利用它们可在已知部分信息时算出缺失信息，且通过借方和贷方能维持资产负债表等式，借方指记入账户左边，贷方指记入账户右边，要抛开现实中对借方、贷方好坏的固有印象，在会计领域它们仅代表左右方向。
借方贷方规则：每笔交易至少要有一个借方和一个贷方；借方金额必须等于贷方金额以保证资产负债表等式平衡；不允许出现负数，要借记或贷记正数。

### 二、账户与账户余额相关内容

1. **账户概念及表示形式**：会计学把所有东西放在账户里记录同类交易，每个账户有正常余额（借方余额或贷方余额），用 “T 型账户” 表示账户，借方记在 “T” 字左边，贷方记在右边，通过借方、贷方金额总和的差额得出账户余额，账户余额变动等式用借方和贷方代表增加额和减少额。
2. **不同类型账户示例**
   1. **资产和费用账户（正常余额为借方余额）**：以应收账款为例，期初余额在 T 型账户左边，赊账新销售额通过借方分录增加该账户金额，收到客户现金时通过贷记减少账户金额，期末算出余额处于借方一边。
   2. **负债、股东权益以及收入账户（正常余额为贷方余额）**：以应付账款为例，期初余额在贷方，向供应商付款通过借记减少负债，赊账采购增加负债用贷记操作，期末余额位于贷方一边。

### 三、借方贷方在其他方面的应用及操作要点
1. **超级 T 型账户**：可借助 “超级 T 型账户”（把整个资产负债表看作大的 T 型账户，资产在左，负债和股东权益在右）理解单个账户增减情况，单个资产账户借方增加金额，单个负债、投入资本、留存收益账户贷方增加金额，收入增加留存收益通过贷方操作，费用因减少留存收益所以有借方余额。
2. **日记账分录相关**：分析交易采用系统方法，将其以日记账分录呈现，思考交易影响的具体账户、账户增减情况以及借记还是贷记，日记账分录先写借方账户（用 “Dr” 表示）及金额，再缩进写贷方（用 “Cr” 表示）及相关内容，要牢记先列借方、再列贷方且缩进贷方内容的规则，后续视频会通过四个示例汇总梳理所学并练习做日记账分录。


### 原文及翻译

Hello I'm professor Brian Bouche. Welcome back. This is the video you've all been waiting for we're gonna talk about debits and credits. Now I have to admit that there is somewhat of a disagreement in the accounting faculty world about whether we should still be teaching debits and credits. I am firmly in the camp where I believe that debits and credits are a very useful and powerful tool for learning and teaching accounting. Plus they still use them to this day. If I had to figure out some kind of complicated transaction and financial statement, the first thing I would do would be break out the debits and credits to help me crack the problem that I'm trying to solve.
大家好，我是布莱恩・布希教授。欢迎回来。这就是大家一直期待的视频了，我们将要讲讲借方和贷方。现在我得承认，在会计学界，对于我们是否还应该教授借方和贷方这一内容存在一定的分歧。我坚定地站在这样一个阵营里，我认为借方和贷方对于学习和教授会计知识来说是非常有用且强有力的工具。而且，直到如今人们仍在使用它们。如果我要弄清楚某种复杂的交易以及财务报表，我要做的第一件事就是列出借方和贷方，来帮助我解决我正试图解决的问题。

So, hopefully you'll find them useful too. If nothing else, you're joining an exclusive fraternity of people around the world that can speak in the world of debits and credits.
所以，希望你们也会觉得它们有用。退一万步说，你们即将加入一个专属的 “团体”，这个团体里的人遍布全球，都能够用借方和贷方的语言（规则）来进行交流。

Let's get started.
让我们开始吧。

As a starting point I have to say that the most interesting thing about bookkeeping is that it's the only word in the English language with three consecutive sets of double letters, oo, kk, ee.
首先，我得说簿记（bookkeeping）这个词最有意思的地方在于，它是英语中唯一一个有三组连续双字母（oo、kk、ee）的单词。

Beyond that, I'm not sure it's that interesting. But these three fundamental bookkeeping equations I'm gonna show you, are incredibly powerful tools for both learning accounting and then ultimately understanding the information that you're gonna read in financial statements. The first equation we've seen before. Assets equals liabilities plus stockholder's equity, the balance sheet equation.
除此之外，我不确定它（簿记）还有什么特别有意思的地方了。但我要向你们展示的这三个基本的簿记等式，对于学习会计知识以及最终理解你们将要在财务报表中读到的信息来说，是极为强大的工具。我们之前已经见过第一个等式了，即资产等于负债加上股东权益，这就是资产负债表等式。

We're also going to introduce the equation that the sum of the debits has to equal the sum of the credits. And at the beginning balance of an account plus increases minus decreases has to equal the ending balance in an account. These three equations must balance at all times. And this will come in handy because many times we'll be missing one piece of information, but we'll have everything else. And then we can use one of these equations to figure out the piece of information that we're missing.
我们还将引入这样一个等式，即借方金额总和必须等于贷方金额总和。而且账户的期初余额加上增加额减去减少额必须等于账户的期末余额。这三个等式在任何时候都必须保持平衡。这会很派得上用场，因为很多时候我们会缺失某一项信息，但其他信息都是已知的，然后我们就可以利用这些等式中的某一个来算出我们缺失的那项信息。

We're going to recognize that the balance sheet equation can be preserve through the use of debits and credits. So instead of having to constantly go back and recalculate the balance sheet equation, instead, all we have to do is make sure our debits equal our credits, and we know that the balance sheet equation is preserved. So what are these magical things called debits and credits? A debit is defined as a left side entry, and a credit is defined as a right side entry.
我们要认识到，通过使用借方和贷方能够维持资产负债表等式。因此，我们不必总是回头重新计算资产负债表等式，相反，我们所要做的就是确保借方金额等于贷方金额，这样我们就能知道资产负债表等式是得以维持的。那么这些被称作借方和贷方的神奇事物是什么呢？借方被定义为记入账户的左边，而贷方被定义为记入账户的右边。

Doesn't credit mean good? Credit my account. Credit card. Credit to society. All sounds good to me. &gt;&gt; And doesn't debit mean bad? Debit card. Debit my account. Debit to society. I hate the word, debit.
“贷方” 难道不意味着好的意思吗？比如 “往我的账户里存钱（贷记我的账户）”“信用卡”“对社会有益（为社会增光添彩）”。在我看来，这些听起来都是好的呀。而且 “借方” 难道不意味着不好的意思吗？比如 “借记卡”“从我的账户里扣钱（借记我的账户）”“对社会不利（社会的减分项）”。我讨厌 “借方” 这个词。

PS, debit and credit have gotten those connotations in the real world. But in the accounting world, debit simply means left, credit simply means right. Sometimes debits are good, sometimes they're bad. Sometimes credits are good, sometimes they're bad. All they mean is left and right. Don't ask me why we abbreviate debit as DR. It's probably something the British came up with centuries ago and we've always done it that way. But that's the way we do it so get use to it.
附言：在现实世界中，借方和贷方已经有了那些含义。但在会计领域，借方仅仅意味着左边，贷方仅仅意味着右边。有时候借方是好事，有时候则是坏事。有时候贷方是好事，有时候则是坏事。它们所代表的就只是左边和右边的意思。别问我为什么我们把借方缩写成 “DR”，这可能是几个世纪前英国人想出来的，而且我们一直都是这么做的。但我们就是这么规定的，所以要习惯它。

Now lets take a look at how debits and credits can be used to preserve the balance sheet equation. So here's the balance sheet equation again and in prior videos remember we did a more complex complete balance sheet equation, where we split the stockholders' equity into contributed capital, retained earnings, and then revenues and expenses.
现在，让我们来看一看借方和贷方如何能够用来维持资产负债表等式。那么，这里再次列出资产负债表等式，而且在之前的视频中，记得我们曾列出过一个更复杂、完整的资产负债表等式，在那个等式里，我们把股东权益细分为投入资本、留存收益，然后还有收入和费用。

Where are dividends? In a prior video, you had dividends in this complete balance sheet equation. I bet you think we aren't even watching the videos we don't participate in.
股息在哪里呢？在之前的一个视频里，在这个完整的资产负债表等式中有股息。我敢说你（老师）肯定以为我们（学生）连没参与互动的视频都没看呢。

Nice catch. I did drop dividends from this equation. One reason is that I was running out of space on the slide, as you can see. But the more important reason is, we're gonna not treat dividends as a separate account going forward. We'll create separate accounts for revenues and expenses but we're just going to treat dividends as a reduction in retained earnings.
观察得很仔细呀。我确实把股息从这个等式中去掉了。其中一个原因是，正如你们所见，幻灯片上的空间不够用了。但更重要的原因是，往后我们不会把股息当作一个单独的账户来处理了。我们会为收入和费用设立单独的账户，但我们只会把股息当作留存收益的减项来处理。

The problem with this equation is that we have the negative expenses at the end. As we saw in a couple videos ago, it can get confusing with working with expenses in this case. Because with any increase in expense would be an increase in a negative number on the right side of the equation which would make it go down, and it's very confusing. To solve this problem, we're going to move expenses to the other side. Now we have assets plus expenses equals liabilities plus contributed capital plus retained earnings plus revenue. And it's all positive numbers. Then we are going to call everything on the left debits and everything on the right credits.
这个等式存在的问题在于最后有负数形式的费用项。正如我们在几个视频之前所看到的那样，在这种情况下处理费用项可能会让人感到困惑。因为费用的任何增加都会导致等式右边负数的增加，这会使得（数值）变小，这很容易让人混淆。为了解决这个问题，我们要把费用项移到等式的另一边。现在我们就得到了资产加费用等于负债加投入资本加留存收益加收入。而且所有这些项都是正数了。然后，我们将把等式左边的所有项目称作借方，把等式右边的所有项目称作贷方。

There are a number of rules of debits and credits that we have to keep in mind and follow if we want the debits and credits to stand in for the balance sheet equation. First is that every transaction must have at least one debit and at least one credit, which makes sense, because if we want our debits to equal credits, we have to have at least one on each side in a transaction.
如果我们想让借方和贷方来代表资产负债表等式，有许多借方和贷方的规则我们必须牢记并且遵守。首先，每一笔交易必须至少有一个借方和一个贷方，这是合理的，因为如果我们想让借方等于贷方，那么在一笔交易中两边就至少各有一个（记录）。

Debits must equal credits for all transactions. And as long as that's the case, we'll know that the balance sheet equation will stay in balance.
对于所有交易而言，借方金额必须等于贷方金额。只要满足这一条件，我们就能知道资产负债表等式将会保持平衡。

No negative numbers are allowed. So you're going to debit a positive number or credit a positive number. You're never going to debit a negative number or credit a negative number. And as you can see in the balance sheet equation above, now that it's rearranged, we don't need to deal with negative numbers for debits and credits.
不允许出现负数。所以你要借记一个正数或者贷记一个正数。永远不要借记一个负数或贷记一个负数。而且正如你在上面重新排列后的资产负债表等式中所看到的那样，现在我们在处理借方和贷方时就不需要涉及负数了。

Now we're gonna talk about accounts and account balances. And in case you ever wondered, the reason why this is called accounting is because we put everything in these accounts, which are areas where we keep track of similar types of transactions.
现在我们要讲讲账户和账户余额。万一你曾好奇过为什么这门学科叫 “会计学”，原因是我们把所有东西都放在这些账户里，账户是我们用来记录同类交易的区域。

Every account has a normal balance. That's the type of balance, either debit or credit, that the account carries under normal circumstances.
每个账户都有一个正常余额。这是账户在正常情况下所呈现的余额类型，要么是借方余额，要么是贷方余额。

We're gonna represent accounts in something called a T Account, which is gonna show all the changes in the account value. We're gonna put debits on the left side of the T and credits on the right side of the T, and we're gonna do that because debit means left and credit means right.
我们将用一种被称作 “T 型账户” 的形式来表示账户，它会展示账户金额的所有变动情况。我们会把借方记在 “T” 字的左边，把贷方记在 “T” 字的右边，我们这么做是因为借方意味着左边，贷方意味着右边。

The difference between the sum of the debits and the sum of the credits, at any point in time will give us a balance for the account.
在任何一个时间节点，借方金额总和与贷方金额总和之间的差额会为我们得出该账户的余额。

Then the change in account balance equation is the one we saw before. Beginning balance in account plus increases minus decreases has to equal the ending balance, where we're gonna use debits and credits to stand in for the increases and decreases.
然后，账户余额变动等式就是我们之前见过的那个。账户的期初余额加上增加额减去减少额必须等于期末余额，在这里我们将用借方和贷方来代表增加额和减少额。

I was wondering why I wasn't getting any questions. Wake up. It's gonna get more interesting, I'm gonna do some examples now.
我还在纳闷怎么没人提问题呢。醒醒啦。接下来会更有意思了，我现在要举一些例子了。

Okay, let's take a look at how this works in more detail. Assets and expenses are going to have a normal balance that's a debit, which means it's gonna sit on the left side of the T-account. For example, let's look at an asset like a Accounts receivable. Remember this is the money owed to us by customers based on sales we've made in the past. It's an asset, because it's money we'll collect in the future. Notice I put a little(A) to denote that this is an asset account. The beginning balance sits on the left side of the T account because it's a debit balance account. Then let's say during the period, we make new sales of a hundred. New sales on account increase accounts receivable, increase the amount of cash that our customers owe us, and we're going to increase the account through a each debit entry. We increase a debit account with a debit entry.
好的，让我们更详细地看看这是如何运作的。资产和费用的正常余额将会是借方余额，这意味着它会处于 T 型账户的左边。例如，咱们来看一项资产，比如应收账款。要记得，这是客户基于我们过去的销售业务欠我们的钱。它属于资产，因为这是我们未来将要收回的款项。注意，我标注了一个小 (A) 来表明这是一个资产账户。期初余额位于 T 型账户的左边，因为它是一个借方余额账户。然后，假设在这一期间，我们有了 100 的新销售额。赊账的新销售额会增加应收账款，增加客户欠我们的现金金额，而我们将通过每一笔借方分录来增加该账户的金额。我们通过借方分录来增加一个借方账户的金额。

Then when we collect cash from customers, it reduces accounts receivable. The customers don't owe us the cash anymore because they paid us. So the account has to go down. We reduce accounts receivable with a credit. We reduce a debit balance account with a credit entry. Then at the end of the period we draw a line, add up the debits, subtract the sum of the credits, and we get an ending balance, in this case of 1,020, which sits on the debit side. Because again, it's a debit balance account.
然后，当我们从客户那里收到现金时，应收账款就会减少。因为客户已经付款了，所以他们就不再欠我们这笔现金了。因此，这个账户的金额必须下降。我们通过贷记来减少应收账款。我们用贷方分录来减少一个借方余额账户的金额。接着，在期末的时候，我们画一条线，将借方金额相加，减去贷方金额总和，这样我们就能得出期末余额，在这个例子中是 1020，它处于借方这一边。因为，再次强调一下，这是一个借方余额账户。

So does debit mean good? I mean, new sales are good, right?
那么借方意味着好的意思吗？我的意思是，新的销售额是好事，对吧？

Or does credit mean good? Cash collections are good, right? I am so confused.
还是说贷方意味着好呢？收取现金是好事，对吧？我太困惑了。

Don't think of debits and credits as good and bad. Debits simply means left entry, credits simply means right entry. Debits will sometimes increase account, debits will sometimes decrease an account. It all depends on the type of account it is. So, hang on for more examples, but just keep in mind, debit and credit is not good and bad. It's just left and right.
不要把借方和贷方看作是好或者坏的意思。借方仅仅意味着记入左边的账目，贷方仅仅意味着记入右边的账目。借方有时会增加账户金额，借方有时也会减少账户金额。这完全取决于账户的类型。所以，接着往下看更多的例子吧，但要记住，借方和贷方并非代表好与坏，它们只是代表左边和右边而已。

Now, let's look at accounts that have a normal balance on the credit side. Liabilities, stockholders' equity, and revenue have normal balances that are credits which sit on the right side of the T-account. If we look at an example of a liability like accounts payable, this is money that we owe our suppliers based on on raw materials that we've received in the past. Put a little (L) to indicate it's a liability because we have an obligation to pay those suppliers in the future.
现在，咱们来看看那些正常余额在贷方的账户。负债、股东权益以及收入的正常余额都是贷方余额，它们位于 T 型账户的右边。如果我们来看一个负债的例子，比如应付账款，这是我们基于过去收到的原材料而欠供应商的钱。标注一个小 (L) 来表明它是一项负债，因为我们有义务在未来向那些供应商付款。

At the beginning of the period, we owe our suppliers a thousand dollars. That beginning balance sits on the credit side, because it's a credit balance account.
在这一期间的期初，我们欠供应商 1000 美元。那个期初余额位于贷方，因为这是一个贷方余额账户。

During the year, we pay $80 to our suppliers that reduces the liability, reduces the obligation. We reduce a liability with a debit, so a debit entry reduces a credit balance account.
在这一年当中，我们向供应商支付了 80 美元，这会减少负债，减轻偿债义务。我们通过借记来减少一项负债，所以一笔借方分录会减少一个贷方余额账户的金额。

Also during the year we go out and purchase new inventory. We purchase it on accounts, so we owe our suppliers $100. That's gonna increase the liability accounts payable. We increase the liability with credit, a credit entry increases a credit balance account. The end of the period we draw a line, add up the credits, subtract the sum of the debits, get an ending balance of 1,020, which sits on the credit side, or right side, because it is a credit balance account.
同样在这一年里，我们外出采购了新的库存商品。我们是赊账采购的，所以我们欠供应商 100 美元。这将会增加应付账款这项负债。我们通过贷记来增加负债，一笔贷方分录会增加一个贷方余额账户的金额。在期末的时候，我们画一条线，将贷方金额相加，减去借方金额总和，得出期末余额为 1020 美元，它位于贷方那一边，也就是右边，因为这是一个贷方余额账户。

I think I've got it! Debit means increase for a debit account and decrease for a credit account. And credit means increase for a credit account and decrease for a debit account. Or, is it the other way around?
我想我明白了！对于借方账户来说，借方意味着增加，对于贷方账户来说，借方意味着减少。而对于贷方账户来说，贷方意味着增加，对于借方账户来说，贷方意味着减少。或者，是反过来的吗？

No, you're exactly right. Debits increase a debit balance account and decrease a credit balance account. Credits increase a credit balance account and decrease a debit balance account. Did I say that right? I think so. Anyway, let's just go on.
没错，你说得完全正确。借方会增加借方余额账户的金额，并减少贷方余额账户的金额。贷方会增加贷方余额账户的金额，并减少借方余额账户的金额。我这么说对了吧？我觉得是对的。不管怎样，咱们接着往下讲吧。

One way to represent this graphically is through something we call the Super T-account. If you think of the whole balance sheet as a big T-account with assets on the left and liabilities and stockholders' equity on the right. Then what you can see is, all the individual asset accounts are gonna be increased by debits because they're on the left side of this Super T.
一种用图形来表示这个概念的方法是借助我们所说的 “超级 T 型账户”。如果你把整个资产负债表看作是一个大的 T 型账户，资产在左边，负债和股东权益在右边。那么你可以看到的是，所有的单个资产账户都会因借方而增加金额，因为它们位于这个 “超级 T 型账户” 的左边。

All the individual liability, contributed capital, and retained earnings accounts Are gonna be increased through credits because they sit on the right hand side of the super t. And where it gets a little tricky is revenues and expenses. Remember revenues and expenses live within retained earnings. Revenues increase. Net income, which means, they increase retainers. Revenues have a credit balance. They're increased by credits, which in turn, increases retainers. Expenses are reductions in net income and hence, reductions in retained earnings. So expenses have a debit balance, because a debit to an expense represents a reduction in retained earnings. I mean there's not much intuition to this. This is just something you're gonna wanna memorize until it becomes second nature.
所有的单个负债、投入资本以及留存收益账户都将通过贷方来增加金额，因为它们位于这个 “超级 T 型账户” 的右边。而比较棘手的地方在于收入和费用这两项。要记得，收入和费用包含在留存收益当中。收入会增加净利润，这意味着，它们会增加留存收益。收入有着贷方余额，它们通过贷方来增加金额，反过来这又会增加留存收益。费用会减少净利润，因此也会减少留存收益。所以费用有着借方余额，因为对费用记借方代表着留存收益的减少。我的意思是，这没什么太好理解的直觉逻辑。这只是需要你记住的内容，直到它变成你的一种本能反应为止。

Dude, can I get a tattoo of this on my arm?
哥们儿，我能把这个纹在我胳膊上吗？

Yeah, you could but maybe a less drastic step would be to just print out the slide or maybe write it on your hand with an ink pen. But I do think it is a good idea to keep a cheat sheet handy to help remind you which accounts are debit balance accounts. And which accounts are credit balance accounts until you have it memorized.
是啊，你可以这么做，不过没那么极端的做法或许是把幻灯片打印出来，或者用钢笔写在手上。但我确实觉得，在你把哪些账户是借方余额账户、哪些账户是贷方余额账户记熟之前，手头备一份速记参考表来提醒自己，是个好主意。

We're gonna follow a very systematic approach in analyzing transactions to figure out how to represent them as journal entries. Journal entries are what we're gonna use to show a transaction in this debt and credit format. So there is three questions we have to think about. First what specific asset, liability, stockholders' equity, revenue or expense accounts does a given transaction effect.
在分析交易以弄清楚如何将它们以日记账分录的形式呈现时，我们会采用一种非常系统的方法。日记账分录是我们用来以借方和贷方格式展示一笔交易的方式。所以我们得思考三个问题。首先，给定的一笔交易影响了哪些具体的资产、负债、股东权益、收入或者费用账户。

Does the transaction increase or decrease the affected accounts? And then should the accounts be debited or credited, and here we can look back to something like our super T account as a cheat sheet to figure out whether we debit or credit to increase or decrease the accounts.
这笔交易是增加还是减少了受影响的账户呢？然后，这些账户应该借记还是贷记呢，在这里，我们可以回顾一下像 “超级 T 型账户” 这样的速记参考表，以弄清楚为了增加或减少这些账户，我们是该借记还是贷记。

Then we can put it in the journal entry format, which is our shorthand for what happened in the transaction. We start with the debit account, we use the abbreviation Dr for debit. The name of the account and the dollar amount. Then we list the credits after that. We indent the credits, put a Cr for the abbreviation, the names of the accounts credited and the dollar amount.
然后我们可以将其写成日记账分录的格式，这是我们用来简要记录交易中所发生情况的方式。我们先写借方账户，用缩写 “Dr” 表示借方，接着写账户名称以及金额。然后我们在其后列出贷方内容。我们将贷方内容缩进书写，写上缩写 “Cr” 表示贷方，再写上贷方账户的名称以及金额。

The key thing to remember is always list your debits first, then list your credits and then always indent your credits.
要记住的关键一点是，始终先列出借方，然后再列出贷方，并且一定要将贷方内容缩进书写。

Okay, this is really important. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I do solemnly swear that I will always list my debits first. That I will always list credits second. And that I will always indent my credits.
好的，这一点真的很重要。举起你们的右手，跟着我重复。我庄严宣誓，我将永远先列出借方内容。我将永远把贷方内容列在第二位。并且我将永远缩进书写我的贷方内容。

Did I just ask you to swear an oath about debits and credits? I think I'm maybe getting a little loopy here. So, why don't we go ahead and stop the video at this point. We'll pick it up in the next video with the series of four examples to help pull together everything we've talked about so far, and then we'll practice doing some journal entries. I'll see you then.
我刚刚是让你们对着借方和贷方宣誓了吗？我觉得我可能有点迷糊了。那么，咱们这会儿不妨先把视频暂停一下吧。在下一个视频里，我们会通过一系列的四个示例，把到目前为止咱们讲过的所有内容汇总梳理一下，然后我们会练习做一些日记账分录。到时候再见啦。

See you next video.
下个视频见。
