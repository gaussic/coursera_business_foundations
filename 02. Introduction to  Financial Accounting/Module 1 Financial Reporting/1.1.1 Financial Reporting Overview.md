### 课程概况

布莱恩・布歇教授开启《财务会计导论》第一集视频，介绍课程将概述财务报告相关内容，包括要求、规则制定、执行及基本财务报表等方面。

### 会计定义阐述

会计是记录企业交易信息、为使用者提供公司财务与经营汇总报表的系统，涵盖记录交易、提供汇总报表、关注不同使用者需求三部分，课程聚焦面向外部使用者的财务会计，区别于用于计税的账目和服务内部决策的管理会计。

### 财务报告要求

1. **申报规范**：美国 SEC 要求公司按不同时间节点提交相应报告，如年度 10-K 报表、季度 10-Q 报表、遇重大事项的 8K 报表，且都需依公认会计原则（GAAP）编制。
2. **适用范围**：虽课程以美为核心，但内容全球适用，上市公司有严格申报要求，部分私营企业也需按频次提供报表，不同国家在申报细节上有少许差异。

### 会计准则制定

1. **美国国内情况**：GAAP 最初由国会确立，权力经 SEC 转至财务会计准则委员会（FASB），新兴问题工作组及美国注册会计师协会（AICPA）也参与部分制定，当前美国公司仍用 GAAP。
2. **国际层面情况**：国际财务报告准则（IFRS）由国际会计准则理事会（IASB）制定，已在超 100 个国家（含欧盟国家）采用，美原本有转用计划但因金融危机搁置，不过两套准则正不断趋同。

### 财务报告责任与制衡

1. **责任主体**：管理层负责编制报表，虽意在运用判断力准确传达经营状况，但存在操纵看法的投机可能。
2. **制衡手段**：有审计委员会监督、审计师意见等，但都有漏洞，监管机构多事后行动，信息中介对管理者制衡作用更大，所以个人需掌握阅读报表基础知识保障自身利益。

### 基本财务报表介绍

介绍了资产负债表（呈现特定日期财务状况）、利润表（用权责发生制展现一定时期经营成果）、现金流量表（体现现金来源和用途情况）、股东权益变动表（反映股东权益变化）这四种基本财务报表。

### 后续安排

教授准备用示例进一步讲解，因时长原因留待下节视频继续。


### 原文及翻译

Hello, I'm professor Brian Bouche. And welcome to the first video in An Introduction to Financial Accounting. In this video, we're going to provide an overview of the financial reporting landscape. What's required in financial reporting, who makes the rules, who enforces the rules, what are the basic set of financial statements. We've got a lot to get to in this course, and I'm really excited, so let's get started.
大家好，我是布莱恩・布歇教授。欢迎观看《财务会计导论》系列视频的第一集。在本视频中，我们将对财务报告的整体情况进行概述，包括财务报告有哪些要求、规则由谁制定、由谁执行，以及基本的财务报表都有哪些。在这门课程中，我们有很多内容要讲，我真的非常激动，那么让我们开始吧。

Let's start with a definition. Accounting is a system for recording information about business transactions to provide summary statements of a company's financial position and performance to users who require such information. 
让我们从一个定义开始讲起。会计是一种用于记录企业交易相关信息的系统，其目的是为需要此类信息的使用者提供有关公司财务状况和经营业绩的汇总报表。

>> Wow, please tell me the whole video won't be this boring. 
>> 哇，拜托告诉我整个视频不会都这么无聊吧。

>> [LAUGH] I sure hope not, but to spice things up a little bit, I will bring in some virtual students every now and then to ask questions or to make pithy comments. 
>> [笑声] 我当然希望不会啦，不过为了让内容稍微有趣一点，我时不时会引入一些虚拟学生来提问或者发表一些精辟的评论。

Anyway, this definition has three parts. The first part is recording transactions. This part turns out to be a big deal, as not everything a business does gets recorded in the financial statements, and sometimes it'll seem like nothing's happening, yet we'll need to record a transaction anyway. 
不管怎样，这个定义包含三个部分。第一部分是记录交易。事实证明这一点很重要，因为企业所做的并非所有事项都会记录在财务报表中，而且有时候看起来好像什么都没发生，但无论如何我们还是需要记录一笔交易。

The second part is about providing summary statements. Large companies have billions and billions of transactions every year. If they made them available to you in a gigantic database, your first question would be, how can I summarize all this into one or two summary numbers? And the third part focuses on users, because different user groups would want different summary numbers. So most companies have to keep three sets of books. Our focus in this course will be the first set of books, or financial accounting. This standardized set of statements is geared toward external users like investors, creditors, customers, suppliers, competitors and any other stakeholder or person that has interest in the company. 
第二部分是关于提供汇总报表。大型企业每年有着数以十亿计的交易。如果它们把这些交易信息放在一个庞大的数据库中供你查看，你首先会问的问题就是，我怎样才能把所有这些信息汇总成一两个汇总数字呢？第三部分着重关注使用者，因为不同的用户群体想要的汇总数字是不一样的。所以大多数公司都得保留三套账目。我们这门课程关注的将是第一套账目，也就是财务会计。这套标准化的报表是面向外部使用者的，比如投资者、债权人、客户、供应商、竞争对手以及任何其他对公司感兴趣的利益相关者或个人。

However, these financial statements are not used to determine taxes. There is a separate set of books based upon tax rules that are used to compute how much taxes a company has to pay. These rules are often quite different from what we do in the financial statements. Finally, there's managerial accounting. This provides customized reports for internal decision making. We're not going to cover this topic in this course, but I wanted to make you aware of the fact that the financial accounting that we do talk about it is generally not used for internal decision making. Instead, there are other kinds of numbers that are looked at. 
然而，这些财务报表并不用于确定税额。另有一套基于税收规则的账目，是用来计算公司需要缴纳多少税款的。这些税收规则往往与我们在编制财务报表时所遵循的规则大不相同。最后，还有管理会计。它为内部决策提供定制化的报告。我们在本课程中不会涉及这个主题，但我想让你们知道这样一个事实：我们所讨论的财务会计通常并不用于内部决策。相反，在进行内部决策时，人们关注的是其他类型的数据。

So what are the financial reporting requirements? The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requires periodic financial statement filings. Companies must file an annual report, or 10-K once a year. This includes a full set of financial statements with a substantial amount of additional disclosure. This thing generally runs 200-300 pages. The other three-quarters of the year, firms must file a quarterly report, or 10-Q, which has a full set of financial statements but less required disclosure than the annual report. If anything material happens between quarter ends, companies must file an 8K, or current report. Material information is generally viewed as anything important enough to move stock price, which means companies file these quite often. 
那么财务报告有哪些要求呢？美国证券交易委员会（简称 SEC）要求定期提交财务报表。公司必须每年提交一次年度报告，即 10-K 报表。这份报告包含一整套财务报表，并且还有大量的额外披露信息，通常会有 200 到 300 页左右。在一年中其余的三个季度，公司必须提交季度报告，即 10-Q 报表，它同样包含一整套财务报表，不过相较于年度报告，其要求披露的信息会少一些。如果在季度末之间发生了任何重大事项，公司就必须提交 8K 报表，也就是当前报告。重大信息通常被视为足以影响股价的重要事项，这意味着公司会经常提交这类报告。

They don't require the financial statements, just an update of whatever major corporate event has happened, something like a top manager resigns or you lose a big customer or there's a lawsuit or something along those lines. 
它们（8K 报表）并不要求提供整套财务报表，只需对已发生的重大公司事件进行更新说明，比如高层管理人员辞职、失去一个大客户或者遭遇诉讼之类的情况。

All of these filings have to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. 
所有这些申报文件都必须按照公认会计原则（GAAP）来编制。

>> Excuse me, does this stuff only apply to US companies? 
>> 打扰一下，这些内容只适用于美国公司吗？

>> That's a good question. I should note that this will be a US-centric course because I'm at a US business school. However, the things that we cover will be applicable globally. So for instance, even though we're talking about SEC filing requirements in the US, every country in the world that has a securities market has filing requirements like an annual report. The only difference you might see internationally is instead of a quarterly report, some countries require semi-annual reporting. 
这是个好问题。我得说明一下，由于我所在的是美国的商学院，所以这门课程会以美国为核心内容。不过，我们所涵盖的内容在全球范围内都是适用的。例如，尽管我们正在讨论的是美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的申报要求，但世界上每个拥有证券市场的国家都有类似年度报告这样的申报要求。你在国际上可能看到的唯一差别在于，有些国家要求的是半年报，而非季报。

This also only formally applies to public companies. But private companies that need to go to a bank to borrow money oftentimes are required to provide financial statements on a quarterly or annual frequency because the banks are so used to getting financial statement information in that format and in that frequency. So this is a pretty universal set of filing requirements that apply to public and private companies around the world. 
这一要求从严格意义上来说也仅适用于上市公司。不过，那些需要向银行借款的私营企业通常也被要求按季度或年度的频次提供财务报表，因为银行已经习惯了以这样的格式和频次来获取财务报表信息。所以，这是一套在全球范围内适用于上市公司和私营企业的相当通用的申报要求。

These periodic filing requirements create much of the tension in financial accounting. For example, let's say we ship goods to a customer in one quarter, but we collect cash in the next quarter. When did the sale occur? Was it when we shipped the goods or collected the cash? And let's say we buy some equipment in one quarter, and then use it to manufacture goods over the next 23 quarters. When does the expense occur? When we pay cash to buy the equipment or as we use it over the next 23 quarters? A lot of what we're going to do in this course is try to figure out what quarter to put various business activities into when we put together the financial statements. 
这些定期申报要求在财务会计领域引发了诸多矛盾。例如，假设我们在某个季度向客户发货，但在下个季度才收到货款。那么销售行为是在什么时候发生的呢？是在我们发货的时候，还是在收到货款的时候呢？再比如说，我们在某个季度购买了一些设备，然后在接下来的 23 个季度里用这些设备来生产商品。那么费用又是在什么时候产生的呢？是在我们支付现金购买设备的时候，还是在接下来的 23 个季度使用这些设备的过程中产生呢？我们在本课程中要做的很多工作就是，在编制财务报表时，试着弄清楚应该把各类商业活动归入哪个季度。

So who makes the rules? Generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, are established by the US Congress, but they're usually too busy trying to do things like investigating steroids in baseball or figuring out whether they should shut down the US government again. They don't have time to deal with accounting standards, so they delegate to the Securities and Exchange Commission. But they're often too busy trying to catch the bad guy, so they don't have time to make the rules. So they delegate to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, of FASB, which is a seven-person board in Norwalk, Connecticut, that has the authority to make the accounting rules in the US. And sometimes they're even too busy to make all the rules, and so there's an emerging issues task force and the AICPA that can also have a hand in making accounting rules, or US GAAP. Now this is just in the US. Internationally, there are international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, that are established by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, which is based in London, and are now required in over 100 countries including all of the EU. 
那么规则由谁来制定呢？公认会计原则（GAAP）是由美国国会确立的，但他们通常忙于诸如调查棒球界使用类固醇之类的事情，或者纠结是否应该再次让美国政府停摆，根本没时间处理会计准则方面的事务，于是就把这项权力委托给了美国证券交易委员会（SEC）。然而，SEC 常常忙于抓捕不法之徒，也没时间去制定规则，所以他们又把权力下放给了财务会计准则委员会（FASB）。FASB 是一个位于康涅狄格州诺沃克市的七人委员会，拥有制定美国会计准则的权力。但有时候 FASB 甚至也忙得顾不上制定所有规则，因此还有新兴问题工作组以及美国注册会计师协会（AICPA）也能参与制定会计准则，也就是美国的公认会计原则（GAAP）。以上说的只是美国国内的情况。在国际上，有国际财务报告准则（IFRS），它是由国际会计准则理事会（IASB）制定的，该理事会总部设在伦敦，目前国际财务报告准则已在 100 多个国家（包括所有欧盟国家）被要求采用。

But as of now, US GAAP is still required for US firms. So basically there are two big sets of accounting standards in the world. But the good news is, for almost all of the introductory accounting topics that we look at in this course, there's a very high degree of overlap in the two standards. 
但截至目前，美国公司仍需遵循美国公认会计原则（GAAP）。所以基本上来说，世界上存在两大会计准则体系。不过好消息是，就我们在本课程中涉及的几乎所有入门级会计主题而言，这两套准则存在着高度的重合之处。

>> Why doesn't the US just switch to IFRS? Do you think there will ever be one global accounting standard? 
>> 为什么美国不直接改用国际财务报告准则（IFRS）呢？你认为会出现一套全球统一的会计准则吗？

>> Actually, in the summer of 2008, the SEC came out with a roadmap that would move US firms to IFRS by basically now. But then what happened was, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, the financial crisis hit and the roadmap dropped way off the SEC's radar screen. So for the foreseeable future, we're going to have two big sets of standards in the world, US GAAP and IFRS. But as I just mentioned, the good news is the two standards are getting closer to each other all the time. The FASB and IASB are working together on any new standards. So, all the stuff that we talk about that's under US GAAP in this course will be very similar to what you would see under IFRS. 
>> 实际上，在 2008 年夏天，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）出台了一份路线图，原本计划基本上到现在就让美国的公司转用国际财务报告准则（IFRS）。但之后发生了雷曼兄弟破产、金融危机爆发的情况，这份路线图就从 SEC 的关注重点中被搁置了。所以在可预见的未来，世界上将会存在两大会计准则体系，即美国公认会计原则（GAAP）和国际财务报告准则（IFRS）。不过正如我刚才提到的，好消息是这两套准则一直在不断趋同。美国财务会计准则委员会（FASB）和国际会计准则理事会（IASB）正在携手制定新的准则。因此，我们在本课程中所讲的遵循美国公认会计原则（GAAP）的所有内容，与遵循国际财务报告准则（IFRS）的相关内容将会非常相似。

So who's responsible for financial reporting? Management is responsible for preparing financial statements. 
那么谁来负责财务报告呢？管理层负责编制财务报表。

>> Wait! What? That is like a professor allowing students to give themselves their own grade. Everyone gets an A plus. 
>> 等等！什么？这就好比教授允许学生给自己打分一样，那每个人都会得 A + 了呀。

>> Yes, that's correct. We allow managers to put together their own financial statements because they have the most information about what happened in the company. And we hope that they use their discretion in financial reporting to better communicate their activities. However, it is important to remember that they may use this discretion to try to manipulate the perceptions, and we need to be on the lookout for such opportunistic behavior. 
>> 没错，是这样的。我们允许管理者编制他们自己的财务报表，因为他们对公司内发生的情况掌握着最多的信息。而且我们希望他们在财务报告中运用自己的判断力，以便更好地传达公司的经营活动情况。然而，重要的是要记住，他们可能会利用这种判断力试图操纵外界的看法，所以我们需要留意这种投机取巧的行为。

So we put in a number of checks and balances to try to curb managers' opportunistic behavior. First, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of management's accounting process. However, this is not a foolproof check on managers' behavior. You know, one of the biggest finance statement frauds ever was Enron, and the head of their audit committee was, was a guy whose full-time job was accounting professor. Which means you could put someone like me on the board and still have these kinds of problems. 
所以我们设置了诸多制衡措施，试图遏制管理者的投机取巧行为。首先，董事会的审计委员会会对管理层的会计流程进行监督。然而，这并非是一种能完全杜绝管理者不当行为的措施。要知道，有史以来最大的财务报表舞弊案之一就是安然公司事件，而当时他们审计委员会的负责人是一位全职工作为会计学教授的人。这意味着，即便让像我这样的人进入董事会，仍然可能会出现这类问题。

So then the auditors are hired by the board to express an opinion about whether the statements are prepared in accord, accordance with GAAP. This again is not foolproof, because in the case of Enron, their au, auditor, Arthur Anderson, signed off on some of the more aggressive things they did, and part of the reason was because they were being hired by Enron to approve their accounting. If they lost Enron because of a disagreement over their accounting, then they would have lost the biggest company in Houston and would have had to go to the second biggest company in Houston which is uhh. Exactly! Who knows what the second biggest company in Houston is? And that's why they want to make sure to keep Enron. The next line of defense is the SEC and other regulators who will take action against the firm if any violations of GAAP or other rules are found. Now these bodies tend to be very reactive instead of proactive, and it's oftentimes after someone else has brought the fraud to the public's attention that they launch their investigation. So by and large, it's information intermediaries like stock analysts, institutional investors and the media that provide the biggest check on managers' behavior by either exposing or fleeing firms with questionable accounting. 
于是，董事会会聘请审计师，让其就财务报表是否按照公认会计原则（GAAP）编制发表意见。但这同样也不是万无一失的，因为在安然公司的案例中，其审计机构安达信会计师事务所对他们所做的一些比较激进的做法予以了认可，部分原因在于安达信是受安然公司聘用对其会计工作进行核准的。如果因为在会计处理方面存在分歧而失去安然这个客户，那他们就会失去休斯敦最大的公司，然后就不得不去争取休斯敦第二大的公司，可…… 谁知道休斯敦第二大的公司是哪家呀？这就是他们一心想要保住安然这个客户的原因。再下一道防线就是美国证券交易委员会（SEC）及其他监管机构了，如果发现有违反公认会计原则（GAAP）或其他规则的情况，它们就会对相关公司采取行动。不过，这些机构往往是后知后觉而非未雨绸缪的，通常是在其他人已经将舞弊行为公之于众之后，它们才会展开调查。总体而言，正是像股票分析师、机构投资者以及媒体这类信息中介，通过揭露存在可疑会计问题的公司或者抛售这类公司的股票，对管理者的行为起到了最大的制衡作用。

But by the time one of these parties get involved, it's a very public issue, the stock price drops and you're in bad shape if you're an investor or employee of the company. So in the end, the only party that's really going to look out for your interest in terms of understanding and trusting financial statements is you. Which is why it is really important that you learn some basics in terms of reading financial statements. 
但等到这些相关方介入的时候，问题往往已经闹得尽人皆知了，股价会下跌，而如果你是该公司的投资者或者员工，那处境就很糟糕了。所以说到底，在理解和信任财务报表方面，真正会顾及你利益的只有你自己。这就是为什么学习一些阅读财务报表的基础知识真的很重要。

So what are the required financial statements? Well, there's four of them. First, there's a balance sheet, which gives a company's financial position, which is its listing of all its resources and obligations on a specific date. 
那么，需要编制的财务报表有哪些呢？嗯，共有四种。首先是资产负债表，它呈现的是公司的财务状况，也就是在某个特定日期对公司所有资源和债务的罗列。

Then there's the income statement, which provides the results of operations over a period of time using accrual accounting. By over a period of time we mean between two balance sheets, so either a quarter or a year. And by accrual accounting, it means we're going to recognize things in the income statement based on business activities, not based on cash flows. Because we have a separate statement for cash flows, the statement of cash flows, which will give you all the sources and uses of cash over a period of time. And then finally, there's the statement of stockholder's equity, which provides changes in stockholder's equity over a period of time. 
然后是利润表，它运用权责发生制会计方法来呈现一段时期内的经营成果。这里说的 “一段时期” 指的是两张资产负债表之间的时段，也就是一个季度或者一年。所谓权责发生制会计，意思是我们将依据经营活动，而非现金流量，来在利润表中确认相关事项。因为我们还有一份单独的报表用于反映现金流量，即现金流量表，它会给出一段时期内所有现金的来源和用途情况。最后，还有股东权益变动表，它会呈现一段时期内股东权益的变动情况。

>> Okay. Could we get an example? This is pretty abstract. 
>> 好的。我们能举个例子吗？这太抽象了。

>> Yes, in fact I have an extended example where we go through a simple business and see what the different financial statements can tell us about what's going on at the business. But it takes another ten minutes or so, so to avoid this being a long first video, why don't we cut it off here and we'll pick it up in the next video. I'll see you then. 
>> 可以呀，实际上我有一个详细的例子，通过这个例子我们可以了解一家简单的企业，并且看看不同的财务报表能告诉我们这家企业正在发生些什么情况。不过这得花上大概十分钟左右的时间，所以为了避免这第一节视频过长，我们不如就讲到这儿吧，下一节视频再接着讲。到时候再见啦。

>> See you next video.
