### 课程总体介绍

本视频基于之前对资产负债表等式的讨论，更详细地探讨资产、负债以及股东权益相关内容，包括给出各项的精准定义、研究可记录及不可记录的情况，并通过诸多实例辅助讲解，最后提到后续会介绍借方和贷方来帮助记录财务报表事项。

### 资产相关内容

1. **资产定义及确认标准**
资产是有望带来未来经济利益的资源，通过两条标准判定确认资产：一是必须经过去的交易或交换取得；二是未来收益价值能以合理精确度计量。
2. **资产实例判断**
   1. **应收账款**：英国 BOC 集团向客户销售价值 10,000 美元商品，客户承诺 60 天内付现，这是 “应收账款” 资产，因有交付货物的过往交易且未来收益（收款金额）可预估。
   2. **非资产（合同约定输送天然气）**：BOC 集团签署未来一年每月向 DEF 公司输送价值 100,000 美元天然气的合同，因尚未发生过往交易或交换，不算资产。
   3. **存货资产**：BOC 集团购买价值 10 万美元化学品原材料，收货时现金支付并获 2% 折扣，是 “存货” 资产，符合两项确认标准，计价按实际支付的 98,000 美元。
   4. **预付租金资产**：BOC 集团支付 1200 万美元年租金且已入驻办公楼一个月，当下有价值 1100 万美元的 “预付租金” 资产，符合标准但因已消耗部分未来收益，价值相应减少。
   5. **土地资产**：BOC 集团以 10 万美元购得土地，是 “土地” 资产，按实际支付金额认定收益价值，不参考经纪人预估的更高价值。
   6. **非资产（品牌名称）**：营销公司告知 BOC 集团品牌名称价值 6300 万美元，因未通过过往交易或交换取得且价值无法合理精确计量，不算资产，这体现会计注重可靠性和客观性。

### 负债相关内容

1. **负债定义及确认标准**
负债是债权人或非所有者对资产的求偿权，代表未来有义务支付现金、交付货物或提供服务，确认负债也有两条标准：一是义务基于当前或过去获得的利益或服务产生；二是支付的金额和时间能够合理确定。
2. **负债实例判断**
   1. **应付账款**：BOC 集团从供应商处收到价值 30 万美元原材料并承诺 60 天内付款，是 “应付账款” 负债，符合标准，金额确定为 30 万美元。
   2. **应付所得税**：BOC 集团预计本季度欠美国国税局 300 万美元税款，是 “应付所得税” 负债，虽交易行为不太明确，但基于经营业务获益处产生纳税义务，可估算金额。
   3. **非负债（聘请 CEO 合同）**：BOC 集团签署三年价值 1.2 亿美元聘请 CEO 合同，因当下不存在基于已获利益产生的义务且金额等不确定性大，目前不算负债。
   4. **应付职工薪酬**：BOC 集团未支付员工最近一个工资结算期内挣得的 100 万美元工资，是 “应付职工薪酬” 负债，基于已获员工服务利益产生义务且欠款金额可确定。
   5. **应付票据及应付利息情况**：BOC 集团借入一年期 50 万美元贷款，是 “应付票据” 负债；刚贷款时利息不是负债，随时间推移未还清贷款产生利息欠款时，未付利息会成为负债。
   6. **非负债（产品被起诉索赔）**：BOC 集团被顾客起诉产品缺陷索赔 600 万美元，虽符合第一条标准但不符合第二条（支付金额不确定），此时不算负债。

### 股东权益相关内容

1. **股东权益定义及特点**
股东权益是清偿债权人债权后对资产的剩余索取权，即资产减去负债后的余额，有诸多同义词。计量股东权益不像资产、负债有两条标准，正确计量资产和负债后剩下的就是股东权益，其有两个来源。
2. **股东权益来源介绍**
   1. **投入资本**：产生于向公众出售股票，发行新股时涉及普通股（按面值计算）和资本公积（股本溢价，即超出面值部分），公司回购自己股票称 “库存股”。
   2. **留存收益**：来自企业经营活动，是净利润累积（净利润为收入减费用后再减去已支付股息）。
   3. **股息相关情况**：股息是分配留存收益形式，不视作费用，董事会宣布股息日记录为留存收益减少额，宣布但未支付时产生 “应付股利” 负债，因宣布后公司对股东有支付义务，此时股东成债权人。

### 课程总结与后续预告

完成对资产、负债以及股东权益的讨论后，下一个视频将会介绍借方和贷方，以帮助记录财务报表中的所有事项。

### 原文及翻译

Hello, I'm professor Brian Bushee, welcome back. In this video we're going to build on our discussion of the balance sheet equation to talk about assets, liabilities, and stockholder's equity in more detail. We're going to provide precise definitions for each of them, and we're going to look at situations where we can record them, and situations where we can't record them. Let's get started. 
大家好，我是布莱恩・布希教授，欢迎回来。在本视频中，我们将基于之前对资产负债表等式的讨论，更详细地探讨资产、负债以及股东权益相关内容。我们会为它们中的每一项给出精准的定义，并且研究在哪些情况下可以对它们进行记录，以及在哪些情况下不能进行记录。让我们开始吧。

Let's start with assets. An asset is a resource that is expected to provide future economic benefits. That means, it's either going to generate future cash inflows or it's going to reduce future cash outflows. There are two criteria that we use to decide, when to recognize an asset. First, it must be acquired in a past transaction or exchange, and second, the value of its future benefits can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision. So, for example, if we buy a truck, the truck would be considered an asset. We acquired ownership of the truck in an exchange. And the value and the benefits of the truck are equal to the price that we paid to buy the truck. So, both criteria are satisfied, and it would be an asset. Now we're going to practice applying these criteria to figure out which of the following items would be assets. I'm going to give you a number of items, and for each one, I want you to try to figure out whether it's an asset or not. If it's an asset, try to give me the account name and what the dollar amount would be. If it's not an asset, then try to figure out what criteria would cause it to not be an asset. I'll bring up the pause sign so if you want to pause and try and answer it yourself you can, but as always you can just roll through and listen to the answers if you'd like. So lets get started. BOC sells $100,00 of merchandise to a customer that promises to pay cash within 60 days. 
让我们从资产开始讲起。资产是一种有望带来未来经济利益的资源。这意味着，它要么会产生未来的现金流入，要么会减少未来的现金流出。我们依据两条标准来判定何时确认一项资产。首先，它必须是通过过去的交易或交换而取得的；其次，其未来收益的价值能够以合理的精确度进行计量。例如，如果我们购买了一辆卡车，这辆卡车就会被视作一项资产。我们通过一次交易获得了这辆卡车的所有权。并且卡车的价值以及它所能带来的未来收益等同于我们购买它所支付的价格。所以，这两条标准都满足，它就是一项资产。现在，我们要练习运用这些标准，来弄清楚以下各项哪些属于资产。我会给出若干项事物，对于每一项，我希望你们试着判断它是否属于资产。如果它是资产，试着告诉我对应的账户名称以及金额会是多少。如果它不是资产，那就试着弄清楚是哪条标准导致它不能成为资产。我会给出暂停提示标识，所以如果你们想暂停视频，试着自己回答问题，是可以的；不过，和往常一样，如果你们愿意，也可以直接继续播放视频来听答案。那么，让我们开始吧。英国 BOC 集团向一位客户销售了价值 10,000 美元的商品，该客户承诺在 60 天内支付现金。

This'll be an asset called accounts receivable. It's an asset because there was a transaction where we delivered goods to a customer, and in return we got a promise from them to pay cash. It's an asset, because that can turn into cash within the next 60 days. And the value of the future benefits can be reasonably estimated because it's the amount that customer owes us on the invoice, and that amount is $100,000, which is what the value of the asset would be. 
这会是一项被称为 “应收账款” 的资产。它之所以是资产，是因为我们与客户之间发生了这样一笔交易：我们向客户交付了货物，作为回报，我们得到了客户支付现金的承诺。它属于资产，是因为这笔款项能在接下来的 60 天内转化为现金。而且其未来收益的价值能够被合理预估，因为它就是客户依据发票欠我们的金额，该金额为 100,000 美元，这也就是这项资产的价值。

Next, BOC signs a contract to deliver $100,000 of natural gas to DEF, each month for the next year. 
接下来，英国 BOC 集团签署了一份合同，约定在接下来的一年里，每月向 DEF 公司输送价值 100,000 美元的天然气。

This one will not be an asset because there has been no past transaction or exchange. Every exchange of cash, good or services, is going to happen sometime in the future. Nothing has been exchanged yet, so there can't be an asset for it. 
这一项不会是资产，因为尚未发生过往的交易或交换行为。现金、商品或服务的所有交换都将在未来某个时间才会发生。目前还没有进行任何交换，所以它不能算作一项资产。

>> Excuse me, both of these two sound like promises to me. Why is the first an asset but the second is not? 
不好意思，在我看来这两项（情况）好像都是（对方的）承诺。为什么第一项是资产，而第二项不是呢？

>> That's a great question and the first example the costumers promised to pay us cash, but we've acquired that promise through delivering them goods. In other words there's been a pass transaction or exchange, which is that first criteria for him asking asset. In the second case, all we've done is sign a contract. If the contract was broken, it's not clear we'd have any basis to ask the customer to pay us a $100, 000. And, so this first criteria, acquired in a past transaction or exchange, is there to raise our assurance that something that we want to call an asset is a legitimate resource that should deliver future benefits, as opposed to a simple promise that could easily be broken, as might be the case if there's a contract that was signed with no accompanying exchange of cash, goods or services. B.O.C. buys $100,000 of chemicals to be used as raw materials. B.O.C. pays in cash at the time of delivery and receives a 2% discount on the purchase price. 
这是个很好的问题。在第一个例子中，顾客承诺给我们支付现金，但我们是通过给他们交付货物才获得这个承诺的。换句话说，已经发生了过去的交易或者交换，这是确认资产的第一个标准。在第二个例子中，我们所做的仅仅是签署了一份合同。如果合同被违反，我们是否有任何依据要求顾客支付 10 万美元还不清楚。所以，第一个标准，即通过过去的交易或者交换而取得（资产），是为了让我们更加确定，我们想要认定为资产的东西是一种合理的资源，它应该能带来未来的收益，而不是一个轻易就会被违背的简单承诺，就像只签署了合同但没有同时进行现金、商品或者服务交换的情况那样。英国 BOC 集团购买了价值 10 万美元的化学品作为原材料。英国 BOC 集团在收货时用现金支付，并获得了购买价格 2% 的折扣。

This is an asset and we'll call this Asset Inventory. Inventory is a term that we are going to use for any product or raw materials that we buy, that we're going to turn into a finished product that we're going to sell at a markup. It meets both criteria. We acquired the chemicals in a market transaction. And the value of the benefits is known here because it's what we paid in the market transaction. And note that the value here is 98,000 not 100,000 because we value it at what we actually paid for it, not some kind of higher sticker price that wasn't what the transactions actually happened at. 
这是一项资产，我们将其称为存货资产。“存货” 这个术语用于指代我们所购买的任何产品或原材料，这些产品或原材料将会被加工成成品，然后加价出售。它符合两项标准。我们是通过市场交易购得这些化学品的。而且其收益的价值在这里是明确可知的，因为它就是我们在市场交易中实际支付的金额。需要注意的是，这里的价值是 98,000 美元，而非 100,000 美元，因为我们是按照实际支付的金额来对其计价的，而不是按照某种更高的标价来计价，毕竟实际交易并不是按照标价进行的。

BOC pays 12 million for the annual rent on its office building. It has already occupied it for one month. 
英国 BOC 集团为其办公楼支付了 1200 万美元的年租金，且已经入驻该办公楼一个月了。

This is an asset. We're going to call it Prepaid Rent. It meets the first criteria because in a market transaction, we paid for the right to occupy space in this office building for 12 months. The value of the benefits are also known. They're what we paid for. But note that, at this point, the value of the benefits is only 11 million. Not the 12 million that we've paid. Because we've already occupied it for a month we've used up one month of the future benefits. So at this point in time, there's only $11 million of future benefits. So we have prepaid rent worth $11 million. 
这是一项资产。我们将其称为 “预付租金”。它符合第一条标准，因为通过市场交易，我们支付了在这栋办公楼占用空间 12 个月的费用。其收益的价值也是明确可知的，就是我们所支付的金额。但需要注意的是，就目前而言，收益的价值仅为 1100 万美元，而不是我们已支付的 1200 万美元。因为我们已经入驻了一个月，已经消耗了一个月的未来收益。所以在当下这个时间点，仅有价值 1100 万美元的未来收益。因此，我们拥有价值 1100 万美元的预付租金。

BOC buys a piece of land for $100,000. It's broker said this was a steal, because the land is probably worth $150,000. This is an asset which we'll call Land. Meets the first criteria because there was a market transaction where we acquired ownership. The value of the benefits are assumed to be what we paid for it, which is $100,000. Now note, we ignore the last sentence about what the broker thinks the land is worth because that's not what we paid for it in a market transaction. And so we're not going to use that as the value of the benefits. We're going to use the more objective number of what we actually paid for it, so we've got an asset, Land, that's worth $100,000. [SOUND] BOC is advised by a marketing firm that its brand name is worth $63 million. This would not be an asset, because we never acquired it in a past transaction or exchange, and you can argue that the value of the brand cannot be measured with a reasonable degree of precision, so it doesn't really meet either criteria. 
英国 BOC 集团以 10 万美元购得一块土地。其经纪人称这简直是捡了个大便宜，因为这块土地可能价值 15 万美元。这是一项资产，我们将其称为 “土地”。它符合第一条标准，因为发生了市场交易，我们通过该交易取得了所有权。其收益的价值按我们所支付的金额来认定，也就是 10 万美元。现在请注意，我们忽略经纪人认为这块土地价值多少的那句话，因为那不是我们在市场交易中实际支付的价格。所以，我们不会将那个价格作为收益的价值。我们会采用更为客观的、我们实际支付的金额，因此我们有一项名为 “土地” 的资产，价值 10 万美元。（声音提示）一家营销公司告知英国 BOC 集团，其品牌名称价值 6300 万美元。这不会是一项资产，因为我们从未通过过往的交易或交换取得它，而且可以认为该品牌的价值无法以合理的精确度进行计量，所以它实际上两条标准都不符合。

>> Are you saying that marketing people do not know what they are talking about? 
你是在说营销人员都不知道自己在说什么吗？

>> No, no, no. I definitely respect marketing people. Some of my best friends are marketing professors. It's simply a case where accounts have decided to err on the side of reliability or objectivity. Without a market transaction where the company has acquired the brand, we can't be sure of how much it's worth. And so we err on the side of leaving it off the financial statements. For this reason, you often see the value of the company in the stock market to be greater than the value on the financial statements, because investors would consider this to be an economic asset, whereas the accounting system is going to ignore this asset as not reliable enough. 
不不不。我绝对尊重营销人员。我有些好朋友就是教营销学的教授呢。这只是会计人员决定更倾向于可靠性或客观性的一种情况罢了。如果没有公司取得该品牌的市场交易行为，我们就无法确定它到底值多少钱。所以，我们倾向于不把它列入财务报表当中。出于这个原因，你常常会发现一家公司在股票市场上的价值要高于其财务报表上所显示的价值，因为投资者会将其视为一项经济资产，然而会计体系却会因为它不够可靠而忽略这项资产。

Now, we're going to turn to liabilities. A liability is a claim on assets by creditors or non-owners, that represent an obligation to make future payment of cash, goods, or services. 
现在，我们要来谈谈负债了。负债是债权人或非所有者对资产的一种求偿权，它代表着未来有义务支付现金、交付货物或提供服务。

>> My former boss called me a liability to the organization. Is this what he meant? 
我以前的老板曾说我是公司的一个 “累赘”。他说的是这个意思吗？（注：原句中 “liability” 在会计语境里是 “负债” 的意思，但这里结合语境是用一种诙谐、引申的方式调侃老板说自己是公司的 “负担、累赘” 了，所以翻译做 “累赘” 更符合语境表意。）

>> No, you're probably a liability in a different sense. Let's go on. 
不是的，你可能是在另一种意义上被称作 “累赘” 了。咱们继续往下讲吧。

Just like assets, there are two criteria for when we recognize a liability. First the obligation is based on benefits or services received currently or in the past and second the amount and timing of payment is reasonably certain. And even though the words are different, these are essentially the same two criterias for the assets. The first one says there has to be some kind of transaction or exchange where you've received something that creates an obligation and the second criteria says you can measure the amount of what the obligation is. So for an example, let's say we borrow money from a bank, we have an obligation to repay the bank based on receiving the benefit of getting the money now. The amount and the timing of the payment is reasonably certain, and if there was any question, I'm sure the bank could clarify how much we exactly owe them. So, borrowing money from a back would meet both criteria. And it would be a liability called something like notes payable or mortgage payable. 
和资产一样，我们在确认一项负债时也有两条标准。首先，该项义务是基于当前或过去所获得的利益或服务而产生的；其次，支付的金额和时间能够合理确定。尽管措辞有所不同，但这实际上和确认资产的两条标准是一样的。第一条标准说的是，必须存在某种交易或交换，通过这种交易或交换你获得了某些东西，从而产生了一项义务；第二条标准则表示你能够计量该项义务的金额。举个例子来说，假设我们从银行借了钱，基于当下获得这笔钱所带来的益处，我们就有义务向银行还款。支付的金额和时间是能够合理确定的，如果存在疑问的话，我确信银行可以明确说明我们到底欠他们多少钱。所以，从银行借款会符合这两条标准，它会是一项负债，名称可以是 “应付票据” 或者 “应付抵押款” 之类的。

We're going to do the same exercise now with liabilities. I'll give you a number of items. I'll give you chance with the pause sign to try to answer them if you'd like and then we'll talk about what the answer is. First item, BOC receives $300,000 of raw materials from a supplier and promises to pay within 60 days. 
我们现在要针对负债做同样的练习。我会给出若干事项。如果你们愿意的话，我会给出暂停提示标识，让你们有机会试着回答问题，然后我们再讨论答案是什么。第一项内容是，英国 BOC 集团从一家供应商那里收到了价值 30 万美元的原材料，并承诺在 60 天内付款。

This will be a liability. We're going to call this liability accounts payable. We use that term anytime we owe money to a supplier. It meets the first criteria because we got the benefit of raw materials in a transaction, which now creates the obligation to pay our supplier and the amount of the obligation is reasonably certain. It's the $300,000 which is on the invoice. So we're going to have an accounts payable liability for $300,000. 
这会是一项负债。我们将把这项负债称作 “应付账款”。每当我们欠供应商款项时，我们就会使用这个术语。它符合第一条标准，因为我们通过一笔交易获得了原材料带来的益处，而这如今就产生了向供应商付款的义务，并且该项义务的金额能够合理确定，就是发票上所显示的 30 万美元。所以，我们将会有一笔金额为 30 万美元的应付账款负债。

Based on this quarter's operations, BOC estimates that it owes the IRS $3 million in taxes. 
基于本季度的经营情况，英国 BOC 集团预计其欠美国国税局（IRS）300 万美元税款。

This will be a liability, we'll call this liability Income Tax Payable. So a little bit hard to see the first criteria here, because there was no explicit transaction. But essentially what happened is, the government allowed us to operate our business so that, so we got the benefit of being able to operate our business in this country, and in return it created an obligation to pay them taxes. Based on the right to operate the business. 
这会是一项负债，我们将把这项负债称作 “应付所得税”。在这里，第一条标准有点不太好判断，因为并没有明确的交易行为。但实际上，情况是政府允许我们经营业务，所以我们获得了能在这个国家经营业务的益处，作为回报，这就产生了向政府纳税的义务，而这一义务是基于经营业务的权利而产生的。

We have to then estimate the amount of the liability even though when we don't know exactly what the taxes are at this point, we can estimate them with recent knowable certainty, we come up with $ 3 million as our estimate, so we would have a liability called income tax payable for $3 million. 
然后我们必须对这项负债的金额进行估算，尽管此刻我们并不确切知晓税款具体是多少，但我们可以根据近期已知的确定情况来进行估算，我们得出的估算金额是 300 万美元，所以我们就会有一项名为 “应付所得税” 的负债，金额为 300 万美元。

>> You said that the amount and timing of payment has to be reasonably certain for there to be a liability. Why is an estimated amount considered to be reasonably certain? 
你说过，要构成一项负债，支付的金额和时间必须是能够合理确定的。为什么一个估算的金额会被认为是能够合理确定的呢？

>> We're going to have to make a lot of estimates in accounting. As long as we're reasonably certain about the number, we should go ahead and book the liability. For something like taxes, there are tax forms available on the web. We have a rough idea of how much taxable income will be during the period, and so we can estimate what our tax liability is. Now, it may not be 100% correct when we eventually file the form. But whatever our best estimate is, is a much better estimate than ignoring it completely. So, we go ahead and put our best estimate on the financial statements. 
在会计工作中，我们将会进行大量的估算。只要我们能合理确定这个数字，我们就应该继续将其记为负债。就拿税款来说，网上有纳税申报表可供参考。我们大致清楚在此期间应税收入会是多少，所以我们能够估算出自己的纳税负债是多少。当然，等我们最终提交申报表时，这个估算可能并非百分百准确。但不管我们得出的最佳估算结果如何，它总比完全忽略不计要好得多。所以，我们会继续将最佳估算结果列入财务报表当中。

Next, BOC signs a three-year $120 million contract, to hire Dakota Dokes as its new CEO, starting next month. 
接下来，英国 BOC 集团签署了一份为期三年、价值 1.2 亿美元的合同，聘请达科塔・多克斯（Dakota Dokes）从下个月起担任其新任首席执行官。

This one is not a liability and it's not a liability because we have, there's no obligation based on benefits that have been received currently or in the past which is the first criteria. Until Dakota actually works for us, and works for us without getting paid, there cannot be a liability. And even then the liability would only be for the time that he or she has worked without pay. We wouldn't book a liability for the entire three year contract because we haven't received. The, benefits for that yet. Plus, there's too much uncertainty with that because Dakota could quit tomorrow, we could fire Dakota, our lawyers, his or her lawyers could find a way out of the contract. There's too much uncertainty over the dollar amount for the three year contract. So we only are going to record a liability for the amount of time the Dakota's worked for us. Since he or she hasn't worked for us yet, there would be no liability. 
这一项不属于负债，之所以不算负债，是因为并不存在基于当前或过去已获得的利益而产生的义务，而这是第一条标准。在达科塔实际为我们工作，并且是在未获取报酬的情况下为我们工作之前，是不可能产生负债的。即便到了那个时候，负债也只会针对其无偿工作的那段时间而言。我们不会把整个三年合同的金额都记为负债，因为我们还没有从中获得相应的利益呢。而且，这里面存在太多的不确定性，因为达科塔明天就可能辞职，我们也可能会解雇他（她），我们双方的律师也有可能找到摆脱这份合同的办法。对于这份为期三年合同涉及的金额来说，存在太多的不确定性了。所以，我们只会针对达科塔为我们工作的时长来记录相应的负债。由于他（她）还尚未为我们工作，所以目前不存在负债。

BOC has not yet paid employees who earned salaries of $1 million during the most recent pay period. 
英国 BOC 集团尚未支付其员工在最近一个工资结算期内挣得的 100 万美元工资。

This would be a liability which we're going to call salaries payable. It does meet the first criteria because there's an obligation based on the benefits we've, we've received. The employees have worked for us, we've gotten the benefit of their services, and now we have an obligation to pay them for those services. The amount we owe is reasonably certain, and again, if there were any questions, the employees would surely let us know how much we owe them. So we'd have an obligation based on past benefits for $1 million, and we'd book a liability called salaries payable for $1 million. 
这会是一项负债，我们将其称作 “应付职工薪酬”。它确实符合第一条标准，因为基于我们已经获得的利益产生了一项义务。员工们为我们工作了，我们已经从他们提供的服务中获益，现在我们就有义务为这些服务向他们支付报酬。我们所欠的金额是能够合理确定的，而且，如果存在疑问的话，员工们肯定会让我们知道我们欠他们多少钱。所以，基于过往获得的利益，我们会有一项 100 万美元的义务，并且我们会将一笔金额为 100 万美元的负债记为 “应付职工薪酬”。

>> In both of these last two examples, we have not yet paid our employees. Why is this one a liability, but not the previous one? Is it because the first one pertains to an executive, whilst the second one pertains to lowly employees? 
在刚才最后两个例子中，我们都还没支付员工报酬。为什么这个（指最后一个例子）是负债，而前面那个（指聘请 CEO 的例子）不是呢？是因为第一个例子涉及高管，而第二个例子涉及普通员工吗？

>> No, no, no. It has nothing to do with status. It's simply a matter of, for a liability to exist, there must be some obligation based on benefits or services received in the past. Employees that have worked for us without being paid, creates a liability for us. Employees that have not yet worked for us, cannot create a liability. BOC borrows $500,000 from a bank on a one-year note with a 10% interest rate. We so, I talked about this example earlier. This would be a liability called notes payable, meets the first criteria because we have an obligation based on receiving the benefit of the $500,000 from the bank. The amount that we owe is reasonable cert, that's $500,000 so it meets the second criteria. So we have the liability called notes payable for $500,000. 
不不不。这和身份地位毫无关系。这仅仅是因为，要构成一项负债，就必须存在基于过去所获得的利益或服务而产生的某种义务。已经为我们工作但尚未得到报酬的员工会让我们产生负债。还没为我们工作的员工则不会产生负债。英国 BOC 集团以 10% 的利率从银行借入一笔为期一年的 50 万美元贷款。我之前讲过这个例子。这会是一项被称为 “应付票据” 的负债，它符合第一条标准，因为我们基于从银行获得 50 万美元这笔利益而产生了一项义务。我们所欠的金额是能够合理确定的，也就是 50 万美元，所以它符合第二条标准。因此，我们有一笔金额为 50 万美元的被称为 “应付票据” 的负债。

>> What about the interest, we will owe the interest on the loan. Shouldn't there be an interest payable as well? 
那利息呢？我们要支付贷款利息。难道不也应该有一个 “应付利息” 吗？

>> Great question, interest is not a liability at this point because we just took out the loan, and we can presumably pay a back rate now without owing any interest. Interest only becomes a liability as the money is outstanding over time. And to the extent that we haven't paid it, the amount of interest that we owe but haven't paid becomes a liability. 
问得好，在当下这个节点利息还不是一项负债，因为我们才刚刚贷了款，而且大概现在就可以按约定的还款利率进行还款，还没产生任何利息欠款呢。只有随着时间推移，贷款尚未还清时，利息才会变成一项负债。在我们尚未支付利息的情况下，我们所欠但尚未支付的利息金额就会成为一项负债。

Finally, BOC is sued by a group of customers who claim their products were defective. The suit claims damages of $6 million. 
最后，英国 BOC 集团被一群顾客起诉，这些顾客声称他们（BOC 集团）的产品有缺陷。该诉讼要求赔偿 600 万美元。

This would not be a liability. It does meet the first criteria. There's a potential obligation based on a benefit received in the past. The benefit was we sold products which turned out to be defective. 
这不会构成一项负债。它确实符合第一条标准，存在一项基于过去所获得利益而产生的潜在义务。这项利益就是我们售出了产品，结果这些产品却是有缺陷的。

Doesn't meet the second criteria though, because we can claim that the amount of the payment is still uncertain. Until we have a settlement or we got to trial we don't know that we have to pay anything, so because of that uncertainty, we don't have to record a liability in this case. 
不过它不符合第二条标准，因为我们可以辩称支付的金额仍然不确定。在达成和解或者进入庭审之前，我们并不知道自己是否必须要支付任何款项，所以由于存在这种不确定性，在这种情况下我们不必记录该项负债。

Finally, we have stockholders' equity. Stockholders equity is the residual claim on assets after settling claims of creditors. In other words, it's assets minus liabilities. A lot if synonyms for this, It's also called, shareholders' equity, owners' equity, net worth, net assets, net book value. Unlike assets or liabilities, there are not two criteria for how to measure stockholders' equity. Because if you measure all your assets correctly and you measure all of your liabilities correctly then stockholders' equity is whatever is left over. But there are two sources of stockholders' equity. The first source is what we call contributed capital, which arises from selling shares of stock to the public. So we'll talk about common stock and additional paid in capital. That's what you record when you issue new shares to the public. Common stock is for the par value, additional paid-in-capital if for everything you receive above the par value. And then treasury stock is what we call it when the company re-purchases it's own stock from investors. 
最后，我们来讲股东权益。股东权益是在清偿债权人的债权之后对资产的剩余索取权。换句话说，它是资产减去负债后的余额。它有很多同义词，也被称为 “股东权益”“所有者权益”“净值”“净资产”“账面净值”。与资产或负债不同，对于如何计量股东权益没有两条标准。因为如果你正确地计量了所有资产，也正确地计量了所有负债，那么股东权益就是剩下的部分。不过股东权益有两个来源。第一个来源是我们所说的 “投入资本”，它产生于向公众出售股票。所以我们会讲到普通股和资本公积（股本溢价）。这是你在向公众发行新股时记录的内容。普通股是按照面值计算的，资本公积（股本溢价）是你收到的超出面值的所有金额。然后，当公司从投资者那里回购自己的股票时，我们称之为 “库存股”。

>> Wait, what is this thing called par value? Is this why there are so many accountant on the golf course during the day. 
等等，这个所谓的 “面值” 是什么？难道这就是为什么白天有那么多会计在高尔夫球场上（意思是因为概念比较复杂，会计们可能会有比较多的空闲时间）？（这里是一种比较幽默的表述，暗示 “面值” 这个概念可能比较难理解）从会计角度解释，股票面值是公司在发行股票时规定的每股股票的票面金额。它是一个相对固定的数值，主要用于公司设立时的股权划分和会计记录等。例如，一家公司可能将普通股的面值设为 1 美元，当发行股票时，这个面值就用于区分股本的基本构成部分。但股票的实际发行价格往往会高于面值，高出的部分就计入资本公积（股本溢价）。

>> I'm not sure why you're seeing so many accountants on the golf course, but it has nothing to do with par value. 
我不确定你为什么会看到那么多会计在高尔夫球场上，但这和股票面值没有关系。

Par value is this archaic historical concept. There used to be laws which said that companies couldn't issue new equity if the value of their stock was below the par value. Where they couldn't pay dividends if the value was below the par value. Most of those laws are gone now. And, par value's main implication is that when we issue equity, we put the par value amount of the proceeds into an account called common stock. We put the rest into additional paid in capital. You'll see this more in subsequent videos. 
面值是一个古老的历史概念。过去曾有法律规定，如果公司股票的价值低于面值，公司就不能发行新股。如果价值低于面值，公司也不能支付股息。如今，大多数这类法律都已不复存在了。而且，面值的主要影响在于，当我们发行股票时，我们会将发行所得中相当于面值的那部分金额计入一个名为 “普通股” 的账户，而将其余部分计入 “资本公积（股本溢价）”。在后续的视频中你会更多地看到这方面的内容。

The other source Stockholder's Equity is Retained earnings which arise from operating the business. Retained earnings is the cumulation of main income which is revenues minus expenses less any dividends that have been paid out since the start of the business. 
股东权益的另一个来源是留存收益，它来自企业的经营活动。留存收益是净利润的累积，净利润是收入减去费用后的金额，再减去自企业创立以来已支付的任何股息。

So what are dividends? Dividends are distributions of retained earnings to shareholders. They're not considered an expense and we record them as a reduction of retained earnings on the date the board declares the dividend, which is called the declaration date. If we don't pay in cash on that date, which is what usually happens, it will create a liability to our shareholders, until we actually pay the dividend on the payment date. 
那么股息是什么呢？股息是向股东分配留存收益的一种形式。它们不被视作费用，我们会在董事会宣布股息的当日（这一日被称作宣布日）将其记录为留存收益的减少额。如果在宣布日我们没有以现金形式支付股息（通常情况都是如此），那么在我们实际于支付日支付股息之前，这会对我们的股东形成一项负债。

>> Excuse me, please explain that again, why are dividends not an expense? They are paid in cash like other expenses, and why are they a liability? 
不好意思，请再解释一下，为什么股息不是一项费用呢？它们和其他费用一样是用现金支付的，还有为什么它们是一项负债呢？

>> Both great questions. First, dividends are not considered an expense because they're not considered a cost of generating revenue. Instead dividends are a discretionary decision by the board of directors to return some funds back to shareholders that's presumably somewhat independent of the company's performance or sales during the period. 
这两个问题都问得很好。首先，股息不被视为一项费用，是因为它们并不被看作是产生收入的成本。相反，股息是董事会自行做出的一项决策，目的是将一些资金返还给股东，而且可以推测，这在一定程度上与公司在该期间的业绩或销售额并无关联。

Second, we created dividends payable, because once the board declares a dividend, it's essentially holding the shareholders' money until it sends the check, making the shareholders creditors of the company. Now, I admit that this one seems weird, because usually liabilities are for non-owners, where as here we have a liability to our owners. But we consider them creditors in this one specific case. Best thing at this point is just to memorize it. Dividends are not an expense and when the board declares but doesnt' pay a dividend, we create a dividend payable liability. 
其次，我们要设立 “应付股利” 这一项目，因为一旦董事会宣布发放股息，在实际寄出支票之前，从本质上来说公司就是拿着股东的钱，这就使得股东成了公司的债权人。现在，我承认这一点看起来有些奇怪，因为通常负债是针对非所有者的，而在这里我们对所有者产生了负债。但在这一特定情况下，我们把他们（股东）视作债权人。现阶段最好的做法就是记住这一点：股息不是一项费用，并且当董事会宣布发放股息但尚未支付时，我们就要设立 “应付股利” 这项负债。

And that wraps up our discussions of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity. Now we have to figure out how to keep track of them. Well the good news is in the next video, we'll talk about those magical things called debits and credits which will help us keep track of everything in the financial statements. I'll see you then. 
这样我们就完成了对资产、负债以及股东权益的讨论。现在我们得弄清楚如何对它们进行记录了。好消息是，在下一个视频中，我们将会谈到那些神奇的东西，也就是借方和贷方，它们将有助于我们记录财务报表中的所有事项。到时候再见啦。
